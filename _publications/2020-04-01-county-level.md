## Abstract

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global pandemic, policy makers have
enacted and reversed non-pharmaceutical interventions with various levels of restrictions to limit
its spread. Data driven approaches that analyze temporal characteristics of the pandemic and its
dependence on regional conditions might supply information to support the implementation of
mitigation and suppression strategies. To facilitate research in this direction on the example of
the United States, we present a machine-readable dataset that aggregates relevant data from
governmental, journalistic, and academic sources on the U.S. county level. In addition to
county-level time-series data from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dashboard, our dataset contains more than
300 variables that summarize population estimates, demographics, ethnicity, housing, education,
employment and income, climate, transit scores, and healthcare system-related metrics. Furthermore,
we present aggregated out-of-home activity information for various points of interest for each
county, including grocery stores and hospitals, summarizing data from SafeGraph and Google mobility
reports. We compile information from IHME, state and county-level government, and newspapers for
dates of the enactment and reversal of non-pharmaceutical interventions. By collecting these data,
as well as providing tools to read them, we hope to accelerate research that investigates how the
disease spreads and why spread may be different across regions. Our dataset and associated code are
