I tutor a small number of young people (middle- or high-school age) who are interested in machine
learning and computer science.

I use original and freely available material, some of which is available online:

- [unfinished-micrograd](https://github.com/benjamindkilleen/unfinished-micrograd), forked from
  [micrograd](github.com/karpathy/micrograd/), with essential code removed for students to
  implement.
- [tic_tac_toe](https://github.com/benjamindkilleen/tic_tac_toe), a Q-learning agent learns to play
  tic-tac-toe in 500 lines.
- [CMSC 16100](http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2017/), by [Stuart
  Kurtz](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~stuart/), used with permission. These excellent lecture notes on
  the Haskell programming lectures are normally taught as an honors course at the college level.
