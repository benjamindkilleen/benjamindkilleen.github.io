~~~ **On the faculty job market!** ~~~

<br/> 

A fifth-year Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://cs.jhu.edu), I am interested in the
future of AI- and robot-assisted interventional healthcare. My [recent
work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QX7AvxUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
advances physics- and learning-based simulations -- from single image formation to room-scale
environments -- as the basis for intelligent assistance systems and immersive educational
experiences. I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments
([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Mathias
Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io), and the Computation Interaction and Robotics
Laboratory ([CIRL](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/)) led by [Greg Hager](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/hager/).
In 2023, I received the [Link Foundation Fellowship in Modeling, Simulation, and
Training](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/news/link-foundation-fellowship/), which supports my work preparing
clinicians for the future operating room using interactive digital twins. In 2019, I earned a B.A.
in Computer Science with Honors from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu), with a minor
in Physics. Outside of academia, I have interned with [IBM Research -
Almaden](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/), [Epic Systems](https://www.epic.com), and
[Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us).

I have published numerous peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers in international
venues, including IPCAI, MICCAI, CVPR, and Nature Machine Intelligence. For a full list of papers,
awards, and press, please refer to my [CV](https://benjamindkilleen.com/files/cv_killeen.pdf).

Throughout my efforts, I strive to foster an inclusive environment for all. I have served as the
President of the [LCSR Graduate Student Association](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/lcsr-gsa/) (GSA) and in
multiple roles on the [MICCAI Student Board](http://www.miccai.org/about-miccai/student-board/). I
regularly volunteer my department, university, and local community. As a member of ARCADE lab, I
have directly mentored the research of more than 20 graduate and undergraduate students, many of
whom have since matriculated into Ph.D. programs. If you are interested in working with me, please
reach out with the [requested information](https://benjamindkilleen.com/contact). I look forward to
hearing from you!

In my spare time, I enjoy running, bouldering, and creative writing. I am an avid fan of art
museums and espresso, especially together.
