I remember Professor O'Leary wore circular spectacles and a wide brimmed wizard's hat whenever I
saw him. Probably, it was a modest bucket hat, yet the man was so much like a wizard himself that
a gray conical cap seems just as likely and better suited to him.

Peter, as he preferred to be called, spent Tuesdays at UChicago. He taught a number of courses in
creative writing, including the succinctly titled "Wizards," and a much beloved "Intro to Genres:
Science Fiction." Among the undergrads, "Wizards" and "Sci-fi" had an awe-inducing reputation and a
lengthy waiting list. I just barely managed to secure a seat in both, first by carefully planning
my schedule (second years get priority for arts classes) and later by emailing Peter two minutes
after classes dropped, thereby slipping in despite being halfway through fourth year.

Indeed, Peter's courses were highly sought-after but not for the usual reasons. Already-burnt out
pre-meds and comp-sci majors preferred to fill our arts requirement with something easy. We felt we
had insufficient energy, between lab reports and breadth-first-search and fiuring out what Hobbes
meant by the "State of Nature," to take on an unnecessary challenge. Art History reportedly
involved rote memorization. The drama course "Taps" had an almost legendary dearth of weekly
readings. Wizards, on the other hand, assigned a different book each Tuesday, on top of the writing
assignments for workshop, and sci-fi had an even heavier workload. Yet Peter's waitlist was never
empty, and his students couldn't wait to get started.

I think the pre-meds and comp-sci majors needed a class like Wizards. We needed to create a space,
within the highly structured world of academia, for something we loved. I allowed us to think about
old sages with walking staffs and pointy hats with the same rigor as delta-epsilon proofs on dusty
chalkboards. While Intermediate Mechanics introduced first order constraints, Sci-fi gave us free
reign of the cosmos. Peter understood these students. He welcomed us with a delighted grin.

In both classes, the professor conducted on-on-one meetings with every student. Lacking an office,
he invited us on a brisk walk around the Midway, a twenty-five or thirty minute circuit, in all
manner of purportedly unpleasant Chicago weather. He apologized for the snow and asked about our
hometowns, our novels-in-progress. As we shivered in the wind,...

Peter O'Leary possessed that rare quality, which is so common among authors yet so rare among
profesors, of being an excellent listener.

...


For the final project, Peter required a polished portfolio based on the rough drafts written over
the quarter, but he encouraged his students to forego this option entirely. Instead, we could
submit personal projects or novels-in-progress, if we wanted. The single-spaced page of
constructive, *usable* feedback which resulted from my own submission informs my writing to this
day.




He discussed our creative work and, in doing so, opened a door that young authors so rarely find
and never search for: someone willing to listen to stories which haven't been written yet.

I didn't know what to expect.


I asked Peter O'Leary for coffee, and instead he offered to take me bird watching.

Peter O'Leary's invitation to go bird watching surprised me at first, but upon reflection it proved
to be in keeping with his usual mode of office hours. In both classes, the professor conducted
on-on-one meetings with every student while walking around the Midway, a twenty-five or thirty
minute circuit, in all manner of purportedly unpleasant Chicago weather. He discussed our creative
work and, in doing so, opened a door that young authors so rarely find and never search for:
someone willing to listen to stories which haven't been written yet. Peter understood why already
burnt-out UChicago students took his classes, which boasted a fair bit of work, and not Taps, the
much sought-after drama class which fulfills the same requirement without any writing. His students
each had a story to write. For the final project, Peter encouraged his students to submit excerpts
from novels they were writing, related to course material. More than a few did.

During his office hours, however, Peter O'Leary didn't overly concern himself with official
matters. He talked about any subject at all, in the way that only a great listener can. What
inspired this story or that one? Where do your characters draw inspiration? What do you want to get
out of writing, and where do you imagine submitting what you've written?

This last question, so prevalent in all our minds, weighed on mine no less. I fear I never utilized
Peter O'Leary's office hours as I should have, when I was in his class. I took his second course,
Science Fiction, in the Winter of my fourth year, and even though I wrote the first chapters of my
current novel-in-progress, I failed to ask the right questions when it came my turn to traverse the
Midway.


 on the Tuesday afternoons he
spends at UChicago, and since bird watching goes just as well with conversation as a heavy
cappuccino, he invited me along For my part, I found it amusing tbut not out of character for
Prof. O'Leary, whom I will hereafter refer to by his name, for that is what he prefers to be
called.
