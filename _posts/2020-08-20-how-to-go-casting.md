The lake is just fifteen minutes from my parent's house, a fact which comprises the majority of its
appealing qualities.  It used to be a quarry, lying at the bottom of the meramec river
valley. Dense thickets and collapsing mud walls border the shoreline, interrupted by camping
chairs, the boat ramp, and a small park with a pavillion. A mossy picnic table sinks into the
Missouri mud. Mercury levels make the fish not-quite-edible. After a rainstorm, trash picked up by
the Meramec floods into the quarry lake, deposity Anheuser Busch cans and Marlboro butts all along
the shallow cover, where bass like to hide. A thick film of grime clings to the surface.

My dad inherited our boat from his brother's father-in-law. "Tilly," as the old patriarch dubbed
her, comes from modest bass boat stock better suited to cat-fishin on the Mississippi, but she
serves well enough for largemouth, and my dad dislikes the taset of catfish. He fishes for the
fight, no tthe frying pan. Tilly has three wooden benches and an aluminum hull, which echoes when
you bang it, and scares the fish away. One bench sports a cool fisherman's swivel chair.

When my dad and I decide to go fishing, usually at an inconvenient time in conflict with the family
dinner, we haul Tilly <!-- is it Tilly or Tillie? --> out of my dad's one-car woodshop-garage and
hook her to the Toyata. On the drive, I play hip hop or alt-rock, to which my dad politely nods
along, until we reach the river valley. Sometimes we talk in the car. Sometimes we wait until we're
out on the water.

To kayakers and paddle-boarders, the quarry lake has one more appealing quality, a strict
"no-gas-motor" policy. This means that our humble Tilly, so often the station wagon in a swarm of
Bass-Pro-lambos, is actually the top dog. She has a main motor for bigger lakes, but at the quarry,
we use a foot-pedal trollling motor powered by a car battery. Once, my dad hooked up the cables
wrong, and we couldn't figure out why we were having such a hard time getting Tillythe boat to go
forward. But most of the time, we trawl effortlessly from cove to cove, the envy of every fishing
kayak we pass. We were once in their shoes, before Tilly, with less space and greater patience. Yet
for all our plumage, fishermen care about just one thing.

"Any luck?" they ask.

"Not today. You?"

"Not a bite."

The quarry lake isn't well known as any great fishing hole. In fact, the longest running joke in my
family is to call it "casting." It's only "fishing" when you catch something.

Thus, my dad and I, with no tallies to compare our prowess, make a game of casting. We like to
think the game is good for fishing, but we haven't carried out any controlled experiment to test
that hypothesis. The game is simple. As we troll round the shore, we cast as close to the fallen
sticks and swamped logs as we can without getting caught. This results in many snags, few fish, and
a great sense of accomplishment.
