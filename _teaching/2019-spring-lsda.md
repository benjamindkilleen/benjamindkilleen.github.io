I am the co-TA for Computer Integrated Surgery I, a course that explores the intersection of
engineers, clinicians, and digital technologies, taught by [Russ
Taylor](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht/) and [Emad
Boctor](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/people/emad-boctor/). Along with [Maia
Stiber](http://www.maiastiber.com/), I hold weekly office hours, give biweekly discussion sections,
and manage graders for the courses regular homework and programming assignments.
