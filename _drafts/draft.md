I write with what is perhaps not the most appropriate of instruments, a brush pen from the Bockwinkel of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Having been left to my own devices by my good friend and most knowledgeable traveling companion, Jonas Winter, who retired to our hostel upon completion of the second floor to take a nap and thereby wrest some of his characteristic exuberance back from the mysterious illness that afflicts him, I decided to adhere to my writing or sometime practice of recording my current state of mind as it responds to such deliberate stimulation as museums can provide and thereby make it a tradition. My aim, as ever, is to turn these intermittent bouts of thoughtfulness to habit.

I am writing on the third floor of the museum, in the room depicting Vincent's death, adjacent to the paintings of his intellectual successors, and in front of that auspicious portrait painted near the ending of the artist's life, portending, as the eye of history would have it, of the suicide that he would bring about.

A red road curves from distance vantage points as ill defined and shifting as the hapless streets of Amsterdam, allergic to right angles, might inspire, and swooping down like jumping rope, and yet suggesting straightness as an arrowshot through fish-eye lens. A field of wheat surrounds and swallows up the road, just barely separated therefrom by a strip of sea foam green, which the mind invites us to believe is grass. It sweeps and sways and swivels from the wind, this lively field of wheat, and strays upon the road where broken stalks bend over, interspersed as well with flakes of umber and road and rich, suggestive green, beneath a dark and raging sky. A light, which might have been the moon, illuminates the land, although no moon that I have known revealed such radiant collors or such graphic tones as this, impressing life upon the grand and death upon the cros, which condescend from some unbroken patch of black upon an otherwise magestic royal blue. The crows come like a specter from across that rolled horizon. Little wonder that this painting earned the reputation that it has, although the plaque protests this ominous interpretation: that the painting was a pretense to the afternoon when Vincent would retire to the country side and put a bullet in his chest.

The passersby take pictures for their Instagrams or stick their camera phones up close to canvases so as to capture video for Tik Tok, a similar affliction on attention to the former. I readily admit to snapping photos here myself, a quick and memorizing act in little way connected with the quality of rendering--a pale approximation of the underlying paint--and rather unlike the insipid nonfluencers who prioritize depiction of experiences such as this over actual experiencing
