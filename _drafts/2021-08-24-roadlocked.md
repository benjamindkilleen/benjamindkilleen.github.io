_Car addiction has created spaces that are uninhabitable -- unless you give in._

---

Apprehensive, I asked, "How do you keep yourself from just flooring it?"

Dad laughed. "Good question. I guess you just get used to it."

The one-way roadway begged me to go faster. SUVs on either side both faced the same direction, shaded by sloping branches off the nature strip. Together with the endless, unmarked asphalt, these reinforced my impression of speeding through a tunnel toward that singular vanishing point beyond my dash. Everything about the street, how wide it was, how straight and smooth and black, signified vehicular speed -- except some tiny sign? The black on white lettering obviously lied. If I were driving my dream car, a Tesla Model S, I would rip this local autobahn from 0 to 60 in 3.1s. Even Dad's Infiniti G20, a four-door sedan too-hot leather seats and a finicky radio, deserved to occupy the space entirely. It felt ridiculous to plod along at fifteen MPH.

Of course, I resisted my inner speed racer. It was my first time driving, and I felt uncomfortable controlling such a hulking mass of metal. My bike was more familiar. But a bicycle just didn't fly in Webster Groves, the milquetoast suburb of St. Louis where I -- from seventh grade to twelfth -- grew up. The roads that beckoned like the one above became such uninviting hellscapes on a bicycle, and disappearing sidewalks next to five line Frankenroads made my own two feet the most unpleasant form of transportation available. I hated working around other people's schedules. I hated waiting for a ride. I wanted my own freedom.

I wanted to drive.

The reason that I thought those two things equal -- freedom and driving -- was the nature of the space I lived in. The car has so ingrained itself inside our culture that we hardly even blink at the assumption made by cookie-cutter double-door garages and parking parks in downtown hubs, that everyone must have a car. To go anywhere is to drive there. And so we strip our streets of plants and trees and niceties, which hardly matter to the drivers, for the sake of extra lanes. We abandon railways, which can carry party-goers and commuters directly into city centers, since a crowded train is much less pleasant than the private cabin of one's SUV, even if the latter languishes in traffic. In many neighborhoods these erstwhile lines comprise the only walking paths not subservient to vehicles, having been converted to biking and jogging trails. Of course, these relics of pedestrianism always feature lots at periodic intervals so that drivers are not inconvenienced by walking on the way to walking. The drivers, after all, must have their right of way. Thus, we make these spaces that are uninhabitable without a car. We make these spaces that are roadlocked.

The roadloacked space is easily identified. First it has deficient sidewalks. I do not mean it has no sidewalks -- although that is certainly the case in many neighborhoods -- or that its own internal paths are not completely pleasant. Rather, the roadloacked space is surrounded on all sides either by highways or by roads whose sidewalks no one loves to walk on. One feels out of place between a 40 MPH vehicular river on one side and gray slab sound barriers on the other. Indeed, one fears for one's life. The sidewalk that connects a roadlocked space to other places is an afterthought, built to satisfy the barest minimum of what a street should do, so that in making walking technically possible, city planners may give no more energy to those inconvenient individuals who do not drive. Of course we take the family minivan around the corner. Who would _want_ to walk?

Second, the transportation infrastructure for anything other than personal vehicles is lacking. A neighborhood may have footpaths in abundance, but without the buses, railways, and protected bike lanes to augment them, its residents will feel that they must own a car regardless. We cannot live entirely in bubbles with a radius of walking distance, after all. If a roadlocked space has any alternative transit routes to speak of, they are like the secondary sidewalks from above: afterthoughts. The buses are often late due to battling with traffic, and the trains run so infrequently that one must match one's schedule to the transit, not the other way around. The bike lanes, often shared with buses or interrupted at the intersections, are so dangerous that only experienced cyclists dare to use them, and the lack of covered racks to lock up one's bike makes the whole endeavor dependent on the weather. Much simpler to drive and not have to worry.

Finally, the grocery stores that serve a roadlocked space are far too big. One might think that this condition benefits consumers, who must enjoy the choice of fifty kinds of Jiffy peanut butter, but in fact it serves the interest of the grocery chains. Logistics networks benefit from fewer points of sale, and a larger store provides more opportunities to advertise to shoppers, who must navigate a maze of sponsored products, ice cream by bananas, separate sections for organic, on a circuitous route designed to be as long as possible. This results in grocery trips that are exhausting. To stay sane, we relegate one day a week to the unpleasant task, so we must buy one week's worth of food per trip. Even if the sidewalks were Parisian promenades and biking lanes abounded, we would have to drive just to get this bounty home. Realistically, one needs a vehicle to eat.

I moved away from Webster Groves six years ago. As a student in Chicago, I experienced living in spaces not locked in by roads, and I loved it. I got used to navigating public transit networks built to serve the whole population, not just those who couldn't afford a car and therefore were of little concern to the local tax base. Transit and bike paths provided not just alternate routes but, in many cases, _better_ routes than roads. I took the 55 to Garfield station, then caught the Red Line to Chinatown, Roosevelt, Van Buren for dim sum, movie night, the way back home on Amtrak. Ubiquitous sidewalks connected every townhouse and apartment that I lived in to this network, with pedestrian bridges spanning Lake Shore Drive. Whether running or cycling, I never had to drive to reach the lake. And Hyde Park Produce, although it didn't compare to those ultra-compact markets enjoyed by Londoners and the like, was small enough for students and professors to fit daily grocery trips inside their busy schedules.

Gradually, I lost my dream of driving. I no longer care what model Elon Musk announces at his hyped up press releases, although I believe Tesla has taken vital strides toward electrifying our transportation network and reducing carbon emissions. Having glimpsed a world beyond the roadlocked suburb where I grew up, I dread having to go back. I envy those New Yorkers with their subway system, and I pity Angelinos with their schedules ruled by traffic. In Baltimore, where I moved for graduate school, I found a city somewhere in between St. Louis and Chicago. The sidewalks are narrow usually present. The grocery stores are large, but they offer free delivery. The buses have seen marked improvements since the pandemic, and protected bike lanes are even beginning to appear, like fairies no one quite believes in.

Recently, I visited the suburbs for a week to cat-sit for some friends. I used their car to commute, as they do, into downtown Baltimore, and I shopped at grocery stores the size of airport hangars. I even jogged the Baltimore-Annapolis trail from their house in Severna Park to the Naval Academy and back, a route which necessitated running on the roadside in two separate places. (I naively assumed the sidewalk would connect their enclave on the Severn to the trail.) In the end, the experience reinforced what four years living in Chicago hinted at: I do not want to own a car. Ever. I do not want to live in roadlocked spaces, and I fear that giving in will make those places too appealing.

The car is not a pretty thing. It preys upon our cities like a parasitic worm inhabiting the small intestine. Voracious, it consumes the avenues. It gobbles up the undigested promenades and puts up strip malls in their place. We tell ourselves, "It's so convenient," while we waste away on long commutes. At least we have our podcasts.

Meanwhile, the spaces we inhabit become spaces built not for _us_ but for hulks of metal many times our size. We don't belong. The windshield warps our perspective, making local roads with 15 MPH speed limits seem like race tracks. The car belongs. We believe in its necessity, and in roadlocked spaces we make that belief a reality.

Ford have mercy.

<!-- We believe in its necessity. We worship at the car. -->

<!-- There are no walkers on the sidewalk -->
<!-- No runners on the trail -->
<!-- There are no bikers on the bike lane -->
<!-- Is the system doomed to fail? -->

<!-- There are just SUVs on local roads -->
<!-- And treadmills at the gym -->
<!-- We kill ourselves with long commutes -->
<!-- To sing our suburb song. -->
