Nine months out of the year, most people called it the multipurpose room. In the basement, off the
hall from the cafeteria, in the same corridor as the weight room and the lockers, the room had the
proportions of a dance studio or a wine cellar. It was neither. In fact, it felt vaguely
purposeless for those nine months. Collapsible batting cages hinted at one function, tucked against
the near wall. Their rolled-up green offered a convenient bench for changing in and out of tennis
shoes, as long as you could keep your balance. On the ceiling, an insulating foam covered gray
steel beams, peppered with tiny black dots which once served as the only entertainment during those
mandatory screenings of "Your Body," that the Health teacher had to show, using a TV cart as wide
as the doorway and well-equipped with both video-casette and DVD players, minus one remote. I
remember trying to count the speckles, bored.

The left and back walls of the multipurpose room reminded everyone of its most inherent role.
Health had other classrooms and the batting cages could conceivably be moved elsewhere, but the
orange crash padding, bolted to the concrete of the left and back wall and seemingly out of place
between between cheap, blue-white floor tiles and low-hanging fluorescent lights between the
foam-covered beams, was permanent. In later years, the room would take on other, equally permanent
signifiers of its primary purpose: a painted-orange "champions corner" where every practice ended
with a self-directed set of fifty push-ups; a peg board and seven pull-up bars bolted just above
the padding, at different heights; and in the middle of these instruments of physical conditioning
a hand-painted mural of the wrestling team's logo emblazoned with our unofficial name, "Currahee
Wrestling."

The logo didn't say, "Statesmen," which was our official school mascot. No one complained. The
Statesman was an abstract mascot whose signature top hat and twirling baton wouldn't have inspired
fish to swim. We didn't identify with it. We didn't don "Statesmen Wrestling" hoodies like plates
of armor against the appraising glances of the Such-and-Such High School Eagles, Wolves, and
Wildcats that populate every corner of America in place of their apex namesakes. And we certainly
didn't let loose that vague, unspirited monicker like a wild war cry when nothing else could
capture the primal blend of cameraderie, pride, and dread which descended after weigh-ins. Instead,
we grunted "Currahee" in the deepest voice that adolescent boys could muster, and everyone who
heard us wondered what it meant.

To this day, I don't exactly know what inspired Coach to change the name, separating us somewhat
from the other sports at Webster. Perhaps he objected to the gendered nature of the term, which
would have excluded our female members in spirit if not in practice. I do not know. Perhaps the
vaguely nationalistic flavor of a "state's man" rubbed him the wrong way, at the same time too
large a meaning and also not enough for young wrestlers to carry with them on the mat. Most likely,
however, Coach James Lemay just liked "Currahee." He chose the Cherokee word based on an episode of
*Band of Brothers*, where the 101st Airborne runs three miles up, three miles down Currahee
mountain. It translates as "We stand alone together," a fitting motto for a division of
paratroopers who dropped behind enemy lines with no support except each other. James Lemay wanted
it to fit his wrestling team as well. 

I remember meeting James Lemay on a Tuesday afternoon in August. The previous week, announcements
mentioned open mats for the pre-season, which piqed my interest for some reason. I had never
wrestled. In fact, I really had no business stepping foot in that single-purpose room at all,
except perhaps for Health class. Adolescent Benjamin was awkward, bookish, and still carried
fifteen pounds of baby fat underneath that curly mop of reddish brown hair which could have hid a
bird's nest. I knew enough to bring a change of clothes, but enough to find the lockers. I opened
the first door in the corridor, which was the weight room, and ventured inside despite feeling
consciously out of place.

The coach stood in the back.

"Excuse me," I said, steeling myself. "Where are the lockers?"

James Lemay looked up from his clipboard. Surrounded by squat racks and dumbells, he was a creature
in his habitat, with legs like tree trunks and barrel-built chest. His bare arms had tattoos on
both biceps, some Chinese characters and a stylized Boba Fett, all in black. He had a bald head and
a round face, which was almost cherubic when cleanly shaven.

"Down the hall," he said.

"Um, right."

I considered just leaving. No one I knew was on the wrestling team. My ride wouldn't be here until
5:00, but I could hang out in the library.

After changing into my middle school gym clothes, left over from the previous year, I returned to
find six or seven other boys already warming up on stationary bikes. The wrestling part would come
after lifting.

Every wrestler stands alone on the mat, but unlike swimmers and runners and others who compete for
individual medals, we can never practice on our own. Drilling moves requires a partner, preferably
one with roughly equal weight and skill, who ultimately teaches you more about a given move than
the instructor. The sport of wrestling, as I experienced it, depended on being part of a group.

<!-- This idea is pretty central to the theme, and also pretty definitive of everything in high
school, but also salient because it's pretty definitive of human nature. Now, to figure out what to
say about it... -->

<!-- TODO: need more transition to talk about this first day of the pre-season. -->

<!-- TODO: I think maybe the dip into the present is a little quick? I want to focus on that
strange decision, both to join in the first place and later not to quit. I guess this is a part of
that. The answer is some kind of stubborness, in retrospect, but really I don't know and couln't
tell you then or now. -->

On that first day in early November, sometimes after the regular football season but before the end
of hte post-season, the multipurpose room became the wrestling room. In that yearly ritual, which
necessarily took place before any other, we wdragged out the mats from the storage closet at the
back of the room and taped them down, to remain there for the duration of the season. This was no
simple matter. Each mat weighed more than seven freshmen and required extraordinary coordination of
mostly new recruits to maneuver through the inconveniently positioned doorway. Upperclassmen, eager
to get started, directed the younger boys and, in my years, two or three fearless young
women. 

Eventually, we finished the mats. We shed our shoes and applied antibacterial foam, which was
universally required, to arm and leg and face and neck. For warmup, we jogged for ten minutes in a
tight circle around the room, during which exercise the coaches, the upperclassmen, and the
occasional daring freshman shouted, "Ten, ten, and ten."

Instantly, everybody dropped, as if the coach or boy or girl had been a commanding officer of our
namesake paratroopers announcing incoming fire, and fell into ten push-ups, ten crunches, and ten
v-ups. We did them quickly. No one wanted to be the last one with his back on the mat, still
counting dots in the ceiling foam.

After warmup, one of the wrestlers led the stretch. Ten seconds touch your toes. Ten seconds arm
circles. Down on the ground and crack your back, then bridge up on the back of your head. Keep that
head up. Neck stretch. Roll it out.

"All right, circle up," Lemay said when we had finished. By this he meant gather in a tight
semicircle in the center of the mat, either standing or sitting at attention, on one knee. You
weren't supposed to sit at ease, on your butt. Some of the freshmen didn't know. They quickly
learned by imitation.

Lemay had a short speech on the first day. The longer speeches would come later, about pushing
through and eating right -- not staving ourselves, as the sterotype depicts, but not wolfing down a
Christmas dish of sugar cookies after practice either. But early on, short speeches left time for
extra conditioning, which was more important. Nobody entered that room with the physical fitness to
last six minutes on the mat, but within three weeks they would have to. Coach knew that. He also
knew that roughly half of the newcomers, along with a handful of upperclassmen, would quit before
the second week. That was all right. He would rather have a dedicated roster than a full one.

So Lemay stood there and he gave us a few simple directions. Practice started at 3:00 P.M.. It
ended at 5:30, but we should shower after, so plan on 6 P.M. for pickup. Saturday practices were
optional, but unless you had a family reunion somewhere in Kansas, you should probably be there. No
ride? Run. Too far? Coach or one of the upperclassmen will come and pick you up, shake you out of
bed if necessary. Lemay didn't want anyone left out.

I hesitate to describe the man, in case the stereotypes about men with his appearance convey more
about his character than his actions, but any mention of James Lemay would be incomplete if it did
not convey the commanding nature of his physical presence. The man had an alpha-male gorilla's
chest and a dancer's gait. His massive arms had tattoos on both biceps, some Chinese characters on
one and a stylized Boba Fett on the other, all in black. He kept a shaved scalp and a cool head. He
had a temper -- it was hard not to, in that sport -- but he demonstrated how to control his anger
whenever it arose, a skill that stood in stark contrast to the coaches and fathers we sometimes saw
at other schools, chewing out the kids who got pinned. When Lemay got mad, he carried it off by
himself, and he came back calm.

Sometimes Lemay had a beard, and sometimes he kept his face clean. When the man shaved, he had a
youthful, almost cherubic face that was difficult to reconcile with the rest of him. Bearded, he
looked like the Godfather's bodyguard: intimidating. Every November, he transitioned from the
former state to the latter, beginning with the first practice and lasting until the beginning of
dual meets. Even then, he wstill wouldn't shave until the Currahee wrestlers carried home a victory
for the team, at which point every member of the varsity roster took turns with the razor, while
Lemay leaned over a trash can, his face covered in Barbasol. Most of us had barely started shaving
ourselves, but he trusted us all the same.

I still can't really explain what made me one of those who heard Lemay's longer speeches and helped
to shave his beard, instead of those who decided that wrestling wasn't for hem. I didn't quit the
first week or the second, and except for one season when classwork was too demanding, I stuck with
wrestling to the end of high school. It didn't make much sense. By rights, I had no business
stepping foot in that single-purpose room with forty other boys and two or three young women. I was
awkward, nerdy, and still carried fifteen pounds of baby fat. Meets scared me. Tournaments were
terrifying. I got pinned in the first seven or eight matches I wrestled and went to bed with red
eyes from crying, that first year.

But I had never felt so much like I belonged to any group of brothers and sisters as I did to the
Currahee Wrestlers. The keyword in our rallying cry was Lemay's addition to the original: "We stand
alone, together," on our hoodies, in our hearts, and seeping into the white concrete walls of the
wrestling room every time we chanted, all together, "Currahee!"
