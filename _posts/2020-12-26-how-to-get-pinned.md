Eight months out of the year, most people called it the multipurpose room. It had the proportions
of a dance studio or a chemistry lab -- although it was neither -- and inhabited the same basement
hallway as the weight room and the lockers, containing neither weights nor changing areas. Two
collapsible pitching cages hinted at one function, tucked against the near side wall, but for the
most part their rolled-up turf served as a convenient bench for changing out of tennis shoes, not
in use. Above these, gray steel beams supported the corrugated ceiling, covered in an insulating
foam. The foam was peppered with tiny black dots, which once served as the only entertainment
during a mandatory screening of "Your Body," that the Health teacher showed, using a TV cart as
wide as the doorway, well-equipped with both video-casette and DVD players, minus one remote. We
sat on the floor, since the makeshift classroom had little in the way of seating. It was not, after
all, really a classroom.

Even during those eight months, however, the walls of the multipurpose room reminded visitors
exactly what that place became, for four long months, and really always was. Health had other
classrooms; the pitching cages could conceivably be moved upstairs; but the orange crash padding,
bolted into concrete and seemingly out of place between between cheap, blue-white floor tiles and
pale fluorescent lights, was permanent. It really belonged. In later years, the room would take on
other fixed signifiers of the same function: a painted-orange "champions corner" in the back left,
a peg board and seven pull-up bars along one wall, and in the middle of these instruments a
hand-painted mural of the team's logo emblazoned with our unofficial name, "Currahee Wrestling."

The logo didn't say "Statesmen" anywhere, although it maybe should have. The statesman was
Webster's official mascot, a somewhat abstract figure for high school sports. The signature top hat
and twirling baton which adorned football players' lettermen jackets had no obvious connection to
the idea of a civil servant and, in any case, struck everyone as meaningless if they made any
impression at all. Certainly, the statesman didn't inspire us. We didn't don "Statesmen Wrestling"
hoodies like plates of armor against the appraising glances of the Such-and-Such High School
Eagles, Wolves, and Wildcats that populate St. Louis County, and we certainly didn't let loose that
vague, unspirited monicker like a wild war cry when nothing else could capture the primal blend of
cameraderie, pride, and dread which descended after weigh-ins. Instead, we grunted "Currahee," and
everyone who heard us wondered what it meant.

To this day, I don't know exactly what inspired Coach to change the name, separating his wrestlers
from the other sports at Webster. Perhaps he objected to the gendered nature of the term, which
would have excluded our female members in spirit if not in practice. I do not know. Perhaps the
vaguely nationalistic flavor of a "state's man" rubbed him the wrong way, possessing too large a
meaning and also too little for young wrestlers to carry with them on the mat. Coach James Lemay
preferred the meaning of "Currahee." He chose the word based on an episode of *Band of Brothers*,
where the 101st Airborne runs the Currahee mountain: three miles up, three miles down. Derived from
a Cherokee word, "currahee" translates as "We stand alone together," a fitting motto for a division
of paratroopers who dropped behind enemy lines with no support except each other. James Lemay
wanted it to fit his wrestling team as well, when they walked out on the mat.

On the first day of practice, the multipurpose room transformed into the wrestling room. The team
would drag the mats out from the storage closet and tape them down, to remain there for the next
four months. This was no simple matter. Each mat weighed more than seven freshmen could carry and
offered little in the way of handholds. It required extraordinary coordination of mostly new
recruits to maneuver through the doorway, which the upperclassmen provided by directing the younger
boys and two or three young women, also new, to grip the sides and tilt it back, slowly. Lift with
the legs. Don't scrape on the door handle.

Eventually, we finished the mats and got ready for practice. We shed our shoes and applied
antibacterial foam to arm and leg and face and neck. For warmup, we jogged for ten minutes in a
tight circle around the room, during which exercise the coaches, the upperclassmen, and the
occasional daring freshman shouted, "Ten, ten, and ten."

Instantly, everybody dropped, as if the coach or boy or girl had been a commanding officer of our
namesake paratroopers announcing incoming fire, and fell into ten push-ups, ten crunches, and ten
v-ups. We did them quickly. No one wanted to be the last one with his back on the mat, still
counting dots on the ceiling. 

After warmup, one of the wrestlers led the stretch. Ten seconds touch your toes. Ten seconds arm
circles. Down on the ground and crack your back, then bridge up on the back of your head. Keep that
head up. Neck stretch. Roll it out.

"All right, circle up," Lemay said when we had finished. By this he meant gather in a tight
semicircle in the center of the mat, either standing or sitting at attention, on one knee. You
weren't supposed to sit at ease, on your butt. Some of the freshmen didn't know. They quickly
learned by imitation.

James Lemay stood in the center. The man had a commanding presence without really trying. His
workout shirts were never big enough for his biceps, which were tattooed with some Chinese
characters and a stylized Boba Fett, all in black. He had a round face and a bald head that nestled
in his thick neck like a silverback gorilla's. Cleanly shaven, the man looked almost cherubic, and
he smiled broadly at the number of new faces. 

Lemay had a short speech on the first day. The longer speeches would come later, about pushing
through and eating right -- not starving ourselves but not wolfing down a plate of brownies the
night before a meet either -- and about the mentality of wrestling. The longer speeches always had
to do with mentality. But early on, short speeches left time for long conditioning, which was more
important.

"This is a hard sport," he told us. "Every year, I ask myself if I should go easier on you
guys. Maybe then more of you would stick around. But then I would be doing you a disservice, when
you go out on that mat. If I don't push you harder than you can push yourselves, that's how you get
pinned. And then you're the guy with his back on the mat still staring up at the ceiling, wondering
what the hell happened, while the other guy is getting his hand raised. Or girl."

The upperclassmen nodded along with the speech, while a good number of freshmen wondered if we
should be here. I was one of them. Before that Fall, I had never even thought about wrestling. I
wasn't particularly athletic, except for a recurring bout of springtime baseball, and had other
interests. I was awkward, bookish, and still carried fifteen pounds of baby fat underneath a curly
mop of reddish brown hair which could have been a bird's nest. Really, I had no business stepping
foot in that single-purpose room at all, except perhaps for Health class, and in my gut I knew I
wouldn't be there long. Somewhere, the back of my head was already planning how to quit with some
dignity, maybe join the chess club.

Practice had a rhythm to it. Lemay or one of the other coaches demonstrated a move, and everyone
emulated it. Shooting the leg, you wanted to plant your foot and propel over the attacking knee, to
grab their ankle. At first, we drilled against invisible legs in rows of eight, shooting successive
shots from the batting cages to the orange padding, rolling over each knee with smooth intensity
until we smacked into opposite wall, jogged back to the beginning. 

New exercise: holding a squat position for two minutes at a time. On the mat, a wrestler maintains
a low stance that sets their quads on fire but made them more difficult to attack. You could always
tell when your opponent was ready to get pinned when they started standing taller, exhausted.

Next move: sprawl. When someone shot on you, you wanted to get your legs out of the way. You did
that by slamming your hip down on their shoulder, with the full intention of slamming it into the
mat. Without an actual attacker, that was what we did. Coach shouted, "Sprawl!" and two dozen hips
hit the ground like an avalanche, only to pop back up, squat low for another fifteen, fourteen
seconds before -- "Sprawl!" -- we dropped again.

At this point, even the upperclassmen struggled. The whole team was tired. We straightened whenever
we felt like we could get away with it, and our clean sprawls devolved into half-hearted
flops. Now, if not before, we knew why wrestling was the only sport at Webster that didn't
hold tryouts. It didn't need them.

At the end of it, practice still wasn't over. "Start running," Lemay said.

Wearily, all of us got up off the mat and started a light jog around the edge of it. Coach stood in
the middle of us, arms folded, contemplating how to end practice. We had another fifteen
minutes. He seemed content to let us run it out.

Then one of the seniors shouted, at the top of his lungs, "CURRAHEE!"

It was so surprising that the freshmen didn't know what to do. The response came from sophomores
and juniors, who echoed, "Currahee!"

"CURRAHEE," the senior repeated.

This time we all joined in. "Currahee!"

"WE," he continued.

"We!"

"STAND."

"Stand!"

"ALONE."

"Alone!"

"TOGETHER." The senior's breath almost gave out on the final syllable, but we echoed him all the same.

"TOGETHER!"

We kept running until the clock said 5:25. One of the freshmen even dared to lead another round of
"Currahee." One of the young women, I remember.

"All right, circle up," said Lemay, when it was finished. He seemed satisfied.

He spent the last five minutes of practice going over logistics. Practice started at 3:00 P.M.. It
ended at 5:30, but everyone should shower after, so plan on being done by 6 P.M.. Saturday
practices were optional, but unless you had a family reunion somewhere in Kansas, you should
probably be there. No ride? Run. Too far? Coach or one of the upperclassmen would come and pick you
up and bring you breakfast if necessary. Lemay didn't want anyone left out.

I listened in a daze, breathing hard. I barely heard when Lemay called us into a huddle.

"Now, practice is over," he told us, with all our hands in the middle. "But do you see that
corner?"

It was the back left.

"That's the champions corner," Lemay said. "Practice is over, but if you want, you can do fifty
pushups at the end of practice. Totally up to you. Now, 'Currahee' on three. One, two, three--"

"CURRAHEE!" we shouted.

I couldn't believe practice was over. It felt like eight hours, not two and a half. The next day
would be worse. We wouldn't have to waste time at the beginning, pulling out the mats. I thought
about quitting again. I didn't think I could do this every day, for the next four months. The
prospect of a tournament was terrifying. I didn't know any of the other boys.

But instead of just leaving, I jogged over to the champions corner. Fifty pushups wasn't that many,
and you could take however long you wanted. Quite a few wrestlers were already there, clustered
tightly. They counted to fifty with bated breaths, some of them rocking the reps like it was a
race, others taking their time. They broke fifty into five sets of ten, two of twenty five, or two
of twenty and one ten. It didn't matter. They still did them together. 

Without my asking, one of them made room for me. I threw my hips back and dropped to the mat. I
could barely lift myself back up again, but I did. Fifty push-ups later, I headed off the mat. I
would be back. I still believed I would probably quit eventually, but I could do one more day, one
more week.

Currahee, after all.

<!-- ourselves, but he trusted us all the same. -->
<!-- <\!-- TODO: make clear that I wasn't on varsity when this happened the first year. -\-> -->

<!-- I still can't explain what made me one of those who heard Lemay's longer speeches and watched the -->

<!-- Every wrestler stands alone on the mat, but unlike swimmers and runners and others who compete for -->

<!-- one with roughly equal weight and skill, who ultimately teaches you more about a given move than -->
<!-- the instructor. The sport of wrestling, as I experienced it, depended on being part of a group. -->



<!-- The rest of that practice only reinforced my suspicion. Nobody entered that room with the physical -->
<!-- fitness to last six minutes on the mat, but within three weeks they would have to. Coach knew -->
<!-- that. He also knew that roughly half of the newcomers, along with a handful of upperclassmen, would -->
<!-- quit before the second week. That was all right. He would rather have a dedicated roster than a -->
<!-- full one. -->

<!-- I met Lemay on a Tuesday afternoon. The announcements that Monday had mentioned open mats for the -->
<!-- pre-season, which piqed my interest. I don't know why. I had never wrestled before and never loved -->
<!-- sports, excepting a stubborn affection with America's favorite passtime, during which I spent -->
<!-- countless hours squinting at the batter from out in left field. I was awkward, bookish, and still -->
<!-- carried fifteen pounds of baby fat underneath a curly mop of reddish brown hair which could have -->
<!-- been a bird's nest. Theoretically, I had no business stepping foot in that alleged multipurpose -->
<!-- room at all, except perhaps for Health class. I showed up anyway. -->

<!-- I knew enough to bring workout clothes, but I had never used the changing rooms. Feeling -->
<!-- consciously out of place, I opened the first door in the corridor. -->

<!-- It was the weight room. Coach stood in the back. -->

<!-- "Hey," I said, steeling myself. "Where are the lockers?" -->

<!-- James Lemay looked up from his clipboard. Surrounded by black squat racks and rubber dumbells, he -->
<!-- was a creature in his habitat, with legs like tree trunks and a barrel-built chest. His bare arms -->
<!-- had tattoos on both biceps, some Chinese characters on one and a stylized Boba Fett on the other, -->
<!-- all in black. He had a bald head and a round face. When cleanly shaven and smiling, the man looked -->
<!-- almost cherubic. In that moment, he grinned at the prospect of a newcomer. -->

<!-- "Down the hall," he said. "On the right." -->

<!-- "Right." -->

<!-- Outside, I started to doubt myself. I didn't know anyone on the wrestling team, and I didn't know -->
<!-- there would be weight-lifting before the open mats. I considered leaving. My ride wouldn't be there -->
<!-- until 5:00, but I could hang out in the library, reading. At this point, no one would care if I -->
<!-- just left. -->

<!-- I didn't leave. I changed into my middle school gym clothes and returned to find six or seven boys -->
<!-- already warming up on stationary bikes, and one girl. I got on an elliptical. -->

<!-- This idea is pretty central to the theme, and also pretty definitive of everything in high
school, but also salient because it's pretty definitive of human nature. Now, to figure out what to
say about it... -->

<!-- TODO: need more transition to talk about this first day of the pre-season. -->

<!-- TODO: I think maybe the dip into the present is a little quick? I want to focus on that
strange decision, both to join in the first place and later not to quit. I guess this is a part of
that. The answer is some kind of stubborness, in retrospect, but really I don't know and couln't
tell you then or now. -->

<!-- Officially, we were the "Webster Groves Statesmen Wrestling Team," but the logo didn't say -->
<!-- "Statesmen Wrestling." We didn't print that ridiculous top hat and batton on our team hoodies, -->
<!-- those symbols of a mascot as uninspired as the obligatory such-and-such high school Wolves, -->
<!-- Wildcats and Tigers which populate every county of America in place of their apex namesakes. And we -->
<!-- certainly didn't let loose the gender-specific word, "Statesmen," like a wild war cry when nothing -->
<!-- else could capture that primal blend of cameraderie, pride, and dread which descended after -->
<!-- weigh-ins. Instead our wall and our hoodies and our rallying cry was "Currahee," a Cherokee word -->
<!-- which the 101st Airborne Division adopted as their motto, popularized by Tom Hanks and Steven -->
<!-- Spielberg's *Band of Brothers,* which offers this translation: "We stand alone."  -->

<!-- On the first day of practice, Coach Lemay explained his understanding of the word. "It means, 'We -->
<!-- stand alone, together,'" he said. "Currahee." -->

<!-- It was a fitting motto for a wrestling team, whose members grow more close and more comfortable -->
<!-- with each other perhaps than those of any other high school sport, but also those who stand alone -->
<!-- against another boy or girl, a stranger, who means to beat them. On the mat, no wrestler among us -->
<!-- had any help save that roar from the sidelines---not "Webster," not "Statesmen," but "Currahee." -->
<!-- (Maybe use this as a last line?)  -->


<!-- I hesitate to describe the man, in case the stereotypes about men with his appearance convey more -->
<!-- about his character than his actions, but any mention of James Lemay would be incomplete if it did -->
<!-- not convey the commanding nature of his physical presence. The man had an alpha-male gorilla's -->
<!-- chest and a dancer's gait. His massive arms had tattoos on both biceps, some Chinese characters on -->
<!-- one and a stylized Boba Fett on the other, all in black. He kept a shaved scalp and a cool head. He -->
<!-- had a temper -- it was hard not to, in that sport -- but he demonstrated how to control his anger -->
<!-- whenever it arose, a skill that stood in stark contrast to the coaches and fathers we sometimes saw -->
<!-- at other schools, chewing out the kids who got pinned. When Lemay got mad, he carried it off by -->
<!-- himself, and he came back calm. -->
