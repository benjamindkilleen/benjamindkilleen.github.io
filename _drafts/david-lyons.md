David Lyons possessed the kind of casual self-importance that only underpaid professors can.  He
had elbow patches on his jacket. His favorite movie was *The Big Lebowski*. Every class,
Prof. Lyons arrived ten minutes early, carrying a leather messenger bag which was neatly organized
with graded papers, his syllabus, the day's reading, and two cans of green-flavored La Croix. He
drank these intermittently over the ninety-minute seminar, one after the other, while one or
another "that kid" spouted their opinion, man.

David Lyons taught the Spring quarter of Classics, marking a stark departure from his
predecessor. My section had just spent the Winter quarter with an easygoing Indian man who brought
coffee and donuts to class and seldom bothered with who had actually done the reading. We loved him
for it. Although no one ever intended to skip a single sentence of Rousseau, very often Analysis
midterms or modul UN prep had higher priority in terms of long-term impact. It was sometimes
necessary to skim Hobbes' *Leviathan* in the twenty minutes left for breakfast, downing several
cups of coffee after turning in a programming assignment at two o'clock that morning, and pray that
someone else could make up the dearth of conversation. This worked well enough, once or twice. The
trouble started late in the quarter, when almost everyone had caught on and awkward silences
stretched for thirty seconds or more after the kindly professor asked "So, what is the Third
Estate?" Eventually, someone might answer.

The kindly professor let us get away with these silences, thankfully, but there is a reason I call
him "kindly professor." Try as I might, I cannot remember the man's name. His teaching was
unobtrusive --- on our priorities as well as our education.

On the other hand, I remember David Lyons.

On the first day, Prof. Lyons reviewed the syllabus.

Prof. Lyons used to be a consulting attorney. Now he taught "Classics of Social and Political
Thought" to a baker's dozen twenty-year-olds.

In the Winter quarter, my Classics seminar enjoyed an easygoing professor brought coffee and donuts
and seldom bothered with who had actually done the reading. We loved him. Although no one ever
*intended* to skip a single sentence of Rousseau, very often Analysis midterms or model UN prep had
higher priority. It was sometimes necessary to let the readings slide, and this professor was very
forgiving. However, I cannot remember the kind man's name.

I cannot remember the kind man's name. I *definitely* remember David Lyons.

Although we never *intentionally* skipped a single sentence of Rousseau,
sometimes classtime arrived before we realized.

David Lyons carried himself with the kind of casual self-importance that only underpaid professors
can. According to rumor, he could have earned a significant income at a consulting firm, but
instead he taughed twenty-year-olds about Democracy in America and what Karl Marx actually meant by
"opiate of the masses." The decision didn't seem driven by academic ambitions, at least not
then. Rather, it was as if the greener grasses of high-roll consulting waited just beyond the
quarter, and he continually committed himself to one more ten-week course out of the sense that his
short term activity could little detriment his long term prosperity, and in the meantime he had
minds to mold.

Prof. Lyons gave the impression of a lawyer or perhaps an old-fashioned banker. He carred a leather
messenger bag always neatly organized with a portfolio of graded papers, his syllabus, the day's
reading, and two cans of green-flavored La Croix, which he drank while students spouted their
opinions. Once, he forgot the sparkling water. His wife graciously dropped by so that he needn't go
unquenched. The class hardly skipped a beat, despite this interruption, and he merely said, "Go
on," to the underclassmen who had been speaking.

In the Winter quarter, our class enjoyed an easygoing Indian professor who seldom bothered with who
had done the reading and brought everyone coffee on the last day of class. This kind man's name now
escapes me.

David Lyons, on the other hand, let us know that he was a different kind of professor. He stated in
class and on the syllabus that he reserved the right cold call any one of us, asking about the
importance of associations in Tocqueville or what Nietsche meant by master morality. If our answers
failed to impress, he said, we didn't deserve to sit in his class. He never exercised this right to
its full extent, actually tossing someone out, with the fear of such humiliation being more than
enough to make sure most everyone came prepared. However, on one occasion he came very close. The
growing dread, as this poor student grasped at straws while Lyons prompted his supposedly slipshod
memory (slipshod as opposed to empty), made my skin crawl. To hear this student, who may or may not
have merely done the reading too late in the evening, as they claimed, fail to identify again and
again even one reasonable definition of relative surplus value, unaided in the intermittent
silences by empathetic but helpless comrades, too well aware that on another morning they might
have been just as unluck, and to hear David Lyons' ultimate question, in that moment, still stands
out in my memory

"Mr. Daniels," he said, addressing the student by his title, "I'm going to ask you this, and I
trust you'll answer honestly. Did you do the reading?"

"Yes?" said Mr. Daniels, with a tone that tilted upward at the end, making the single word a
question. It was as if he asked, by lying so poorly, whever he might exact pity from the merciless
Lyons.

The professor nodded. "All right then," he said, and he opened the question to the rest of us.
