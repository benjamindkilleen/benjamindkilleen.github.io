Apprehensively, I said, "How do you keep yourself from just flooring it?"

Dad laughed. "Good question. I guess you just get used to it."

The one-way roadway begged me to go faster. SUVs on either side both faced the same direction, shaded by sloping branches off the nature-strip. Together with the endless, unmarked asphalt, these reinforced my impression of speeding through a tunnel toward that singular vanishing point beyond my dash. Everything about the street, how wide it was, how straight and smooth and black, signified vehicular speed -- except some tiny sign? The black on white lettering obviously lied. Even Dad's Infiniti G20, a four-door sedan with too-hot leather seats and a finicky radio, deserved to occupy this space, this local autobahn. It felt ridiculous to plod along at fifteen mph.

Of course, I resisted my inner speed racer. It was my first time driving outside parking lots, and I felt uncomfortable controlling such a hulking mass of metal. My bike was more familiar. But a bicycle just didn't fly in Webster Groves, the milquetoast suburb of St. Louis where I -- from seventh grade to twelfth -- grew up. The roads that beckoned like the one above became such uninviting hellscapes on a bicycle, and disappearing sidewalks next to five line Frankenroads made my own two feet the most unpleasant form of transportation available. I hated waiting for my ride from school. I hated asking friends for rides. I wanted my own freedom.

I wanted to drive.

I couldn't imagine, when I had my learner's permit, just how easy it would be to utterly forget the body in the driver's seat and in a sense _become_ the car. <!-- In a mundane way -->

<!-- The car is not a pretty thing. It preys upon our cities like a parasitic worm inhabiting the small intestine. Voracious, it consumes the avenues. It gobbles up the undigested promenades and puts up strip malls in their place. We tell ourselves, "It's so convenient," starving on our long commutes. "At least we have our podcasts," while the worm grows fat with traffic. We think to sate the beast with interstates and extra lanes, connecting far-flung, fat-cat enclaves to the emaciated inner cities around which they base their whole existence. Yet the car is never satisfied. It -->

<!-- We believe in its necessity. We worship at the car. -->

<!-- There are no walkers on the sidewalk -->
<!-- No runners on the trail -->
<!-- There are no bikers on the bike lane -->
<!-- Is the system doomed to fail? -->

<!-- There are just SUVs on local roads -->
<!-- And treadmills at the gym -->
<!-- We kill ourselves with long commutes -->
<!-- To sing our suburb song. -->
