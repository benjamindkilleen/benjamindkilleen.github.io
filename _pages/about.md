A Ph.D. candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://cs.jhu.edu), I am interested in intelligent
surgical systems that improve patient outcomes. My [recent
work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QX7AvxUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
involves realistic simulation of interventional X-ray imaging for the purpose of developing
AI-integrated surgical systems. I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented
Environments ([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Mathias
Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io), and a [Link Foundation Fellow](https://linksim.org/)
in Modeling, Simulation, and Training. I also serve as the President of the [LCSR Graduate Student
Association](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/lcsr-gsa/) (GSA) and Sports Officer for the [MICCAI Student
Board](http://www.miccai.org/about-miccai/student-board/). In 2019, I earned a B.A. in Computer
Science with Honors from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu), with a minor in Physics,
and I have completed internships at [IBM Research -
Almaden](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/), [Epic Systems](https://www.epic.com), and
[Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us). In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering and
[creative writing](https://benjamindkilleen.com/blog/).
