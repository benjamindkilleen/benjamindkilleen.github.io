A Ph.D. Student at Johns Hopkins University, I am interested in intelligent surgical systems based
on explorative computer vision and deep reinforcement learning that directly improve patient
outcomes. I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments
([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group and the Computational Interaction and
Robotics Laboratory ([CIRL](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/)).
