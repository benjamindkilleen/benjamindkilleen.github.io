Thanks for scanning the QR code! As a PhD student, I cannot sign up for every pro subscription to a dynamic QR code generator. So to circumvent Slack's expiring invite links, I have created this page on my personal website, which you are now looking at! Hopefully, by now, it has redirected you. Or maybe you're just interested in what I have to say! That's exciting. Maybe you'll be interested in my paper here at MICCAI 2023, entitled "Pelphix: Surgical Phase Recognition from X-ray Images in Percutaneous Pelvic Fixation," available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09285) and on display in the poster hall. Or maybe you'd like to grab coffee. If that's the case, or if the link above has expired, you can contact me using the links on the left!
