Professor O'Leary wore the kind of glasses that can only be described as spectacles, underneath a
wide brimmed hat much like a wizard's. It was actually a modest bucket hat. Yet the man was so much
like a wizard himself that the conical cap seems just as likely and better suited to him in my
mind.

Peter O'Leary, whom I would call "Professor O'Leary" except for his own stated preference, spent
his Tuesdays teaching creative writing at the University of Chicago. He taught a number of writing
and poetry courses, including the esoteric "Ecopoetics," the succinctly titled "Wizards," and
"Intro to Genres: Science Fiction." I myself managed to secure a seat in the latter two, first by
finagling the registration system (second years get priority for arts classes) and later by
emailing Peter two minutes after classes dropped, thereby earning the top spot on a very lengthy
waitlist.

The courses were highly sought after, but not for the usual reasons. UChicago students tended to
prefer easier offerings to satisfy their arts requirement, like "East Asian Art History" or "Taps."
According to my roommate, the drama class consisted of three enjoyable hours with a notable lack of
weekly readings. Peter O'Leary didn't bother himself with such courses. He understood that already
burnt-out students opted into fifty page readings and workshopped writing assignments each week not
out of anticipation for whatever knowledge the workload imparted upon them but because they
couldn't wait to get started. Peter's student each had a story to tell. Some of them were English
majors, but just as many belonged to Computer Science or pre-med. We didn't have the energy,
between implementing bread-first-search *before* learning the C programming language and figuring
out what Hobbes meant by the "State of Nature," to write our stories, much less workshop and edit
them. "Wizards" let us apply the same rigor to old sages with walking staffs and pointy hats as we
did to delta-epsilon proofs on dusty chalkboards. While Intermediate Mechanic introduced first
order constraints, "Science Fiction" gave us free reign of the cosmos. During first week, Peter
started each course by asking everyone what they studied. He seemed to smile more broadly, somehow,
whenever the answer had nothing whatsoever to do with creative writing.

Peter O'Leary taught his courses unlike any other professor I knew. In both classes, he conducted
on-on-one meetings with every student while walking around the Midway, a twenty-five or thirty
minute circuit, in all manner of purportedly unpleasant Chicago weather. He discussed our work. He
asked about our personal lives. Somehow, these were seldom unrelated.

For the final project, Peter required a polished portfolio based on the rough drafts written over
the quarter, but he encouraged his students to forego this option entirely. Instead, we could
submit personal projects or novels-in-progress, if we wanted. The single-spaced page of
constructive, *usable* feedback which resulted from my own submission informs my writing to this
day.




He discussed our creative work and, in doing so, opened a door that young authors so rarely find
and never search for: someone willing to listen to stories which haven't been written yet.

I didn't know what to expect.


I asked Peter O'Leary for coffee, and instead he offered to take me bird watching.

Peter O'Leary's invitation to go bird watching surprised me at first, but upon reflection it proved
to be in keeping with his usual mode of office hours. In both classes, the professor conducted
on-on-one meetings with every student while walking around the Midway, a twenty-five or thirty
minute circuit, in all manner of purportedly unpleasant Chicago weather. He discussed our creative
work and, in doing so, opened a door that young authors so rarely find and never search for:
someone willing to listen to stories which haven't been written yet. Peter understood why already
burnt-out UChicago students took his classes, which boasted a fair bit of work, and not Taps, the
much sought-after drama class which fulfills the same requirement without any writing. His students
each had a story to write. For the final project, Peter encouraged his students to submit excerpts
from novels they were writing, related to course material. More than a few did.

During his office hours, however, Peter O'Leary didn't overly concern himself with official
matters. He talked about any subject at all, in the way that only a great listener can. What
inspired this story or that one? Where do your characters draw inspiration? What do you want to get
out of writing, and where do you imagine submitting what you've written?

This last question, so prevalent in all our minds, weighed on mine no less. I fear I never utilized
Peter O'Leary's office hours as I should have, when I was in his class. I took his second course,
Science Fiction, in the Winter of my fourth year, and even though I wrote the first chapters of my
current novel-in-progress, I failed to ask the right questions when it came my turn to traverse the
Midway.


 on the Tuesday afternoons he
spends at UChicago, and since bird watching goes just as well with conversation as a heavy
cappuccino, he invited me along For my part, I found it amusing tbut not out of character for
Prof. O'Leary, whom I will hereafter refer to by his name, for that is what he prefers to be
called.
