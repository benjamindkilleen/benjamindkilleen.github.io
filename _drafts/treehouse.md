When I asked Dad if he could build a treehouse, I didn't think he would actually agree. Being only
nine years old, I underestimated the fragile male ego and the affinity for power tools that would
drive my father, who did _not_ work in construction, to spend an entire summer with his newly
acquired table saw. And me. I also helped.

Our house in Madison only had two trees. The first was a twisted thing with a convenient perch for a
nine-year-old boy, which might have supported a "tree fort," which affixes no more than two planks of wood
and three nails to the highest possible branch, but nothing more. As much as these deathtraps
stimulate the imagination, becoming starships and castles on unfilled afternoons, they result in
just as many broken necks as future novelists, and so my father ruled out the twisted tree. It was
also in the front yard, as Mom pointed out, which disqualified any augmentation from the get-go on
aesthetic grounds.

That left the walnut tree out back.
