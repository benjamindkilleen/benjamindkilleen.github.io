The car is not a pretty thing. I used to think it was. During my first driving lesson, I asked my Dad, "How do you keep yourself from just flooring it?"

The car is not a pretty thing. It preys upon our cities like a parasitic worm inhabiting the small intestine. Voracious, it consumes the avenues. It gobbles up the undigested promenades and puts up strip malls in their place. We tell ourselves, "It's so convenient," starving on our long commutes. "At least we have our podcasts," while the worm grows fat with traffic. We think to sate the beast with interstates and extra lanes, connecting far-flung, fat-cat enclaves -- the suburbs -- to the emaciated inner cities around which they base their whole existence. Yet the car is never satisfied. It

We believe in its necessity. We worship at the car.
