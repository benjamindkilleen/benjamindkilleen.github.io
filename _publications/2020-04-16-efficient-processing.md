## Abstract

According to one or more embodiments, a computer implemented method for implementing a
convolutional neural network (CNN) using a crosspoint array includes configuring the crosspoint
array corresponding to a convolution layer in the CNN by storing one or more convolution kernels of
the convolution layer in one or more crosspoint devices of the crosspoint array. The method further
includes performing computations for the CNN via the crosspoint array by transmitting voltage
pulses corresponding to a vector of input data of the convolution layer to the crosspoint
array. Performing the CNN computations further includes outputting an electric current
representative of performing a multiplication operation at a crosspoint device in the crosspoint
array based on a weight value stored by the crosspoint device and the voltage pulses from the input
data. Performing the CNN computations further includes passing the output electric current from the
crosspoint device to a selected integrator.
