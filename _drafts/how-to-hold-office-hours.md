# Part I: How to Hold Office Hours

Professor O'Leary wore circular spectacles and a wide brimmed wizard's hat. Probably, it was a
modest bucket hat, but the man was so much like a wizard himself that a gray conical cap seems just
as likely in my mind.

Peter, as he preferred to be called, spent Tuesdays on campus. He taught a number of courses in
creative writing, including the succinctly titled "Wizards," and a much beloved "Intro to Genres:
Science Fiction." Among the undergrads, "Wizards" and "Sci-fi" had an awe-inducing reputation and a
lengthy waiting list. I just barely managed to secure a seat in both, first by carefully planning
my schedule (second years get priority for the arts) and later by emailing Peter two minutes after
classes dropped, thereby slipping in despite being halfway through fourth year.

Indeed, Peter's courses were highly sought-after but not for the usual reasons. Already burnt out
pre-meds and comp-sci majors preferred to fill our arts requirement with something easy. We felt we
had insufficient energy, between lab reports and breadth-first-search and fiuring out what Hobbes
meant by the "State of Nature," to take on an unnecessary challenge. Art History reportedly
involved rote memorization. The drama course "Taps" had an almost legendary dearth of weekly
readings. Wizards, on the other hand, assigned a different book each Tuesday, on top of the writing
assignments for workshop, and sci-fi had an even heavier workload. Yet Peter's waitlist was never
empty.

In a way, the pre-meds and comp-sci majors desperately needed a class like Wizards. We needed to
create a space, within the highly structured world of academia, for something we loved. I allowed
us to think about old sages with walking staffs and pointy hats with the same rigor as
delta-epsilon proofs on dusty chalkboards. While Intermediate Mechanics introduced first order
constraints, Sci-fi gave us free reign of the cosmos. Peter understood these students. He welcomed
us with a delighted grin.

In both classes, the professor conducted on-on-one meetings with every student. Lacking an office
on campus, he invited us to stroll around the Midway, a twenty-five or thirty minute circuit, in
spite of the purportedly unpleasant Chicago winter. The chill added urgency to our conversation. He
would apologize for the snow before he asked about our hometowns, our novels-in-progress. As we
shivered in the wind, he listened. Peter O'Leary possessed that rare quality, which is so common
among authors and yet so rare among professors, of being an attentive listener. For young authors,
used to scrawling their manuscripts with the bedroom door closed and the curtains drawn, late at
night, after the folks fell asleep in front of Netflix box, and the dog stretched languidly across
that patch of hardwood floor above the boiler, for us his engagement felt unreal. His students
scrutinize those single-spaced pages of focused feedback more than classical scholars pore over
lines of the Illiad.

For his final projects, Peter required a polished portfolio based on the rough drafts we submitted
for workshop, but he also encouraged his students to forego this option entirely. Instead, we could
submit personal projects or partial manuscripts, if we wanted. 

Having toyed with a single idea for many of the assignments that quarter, I decided to write a
first chapter. The single-spaced page of constructive, *usable* feedback which resulted from this
submission continues to inform my writing. In the excerpt below, Peter identifies the strengths in
my writing, as he did for every student, before he moved onto some pointed criticisms, which I will
omit---although there were many---for the sake of brevity, generality, and some non-negligible
insecurity.

> The things that work avidly in this chapter are many. Some of the things that really stand out to
> me are the energetic opening sequence, which has an absorbing cinematic quality. Philip Pullman, in
> his essays, regularly cites something he learned from novelist, playwright, and director David
> Mamet, who says the question he always asks himself when writing something is “Where do I put the
> camera?” He means not to treat his writing as a preview to a screenplay but to be thinking always
> about visual lines of sight and what the reader will be seeing as they read. In the opening of the
> chapter, it’s compellingly easy to visualize what’s happening because you seem instinctively to
> know where to put the camera. --- Peter O'Leary

At the time, those words meant the world. They inspired me to keep working on the novel, which
inhabited a nascent, amoporhous stage. Peter O'Leary understood that the pre-meds and comp-sci
majors in his classes needed encouragement more than anything, in order to keep pursuing their
passions.

# Part II: How to Go Bird Watching

In my fourth year spring, I experienced those inevitable doubts about what comes next. I asked
Peter O'Leary for coffee, and instead he took me bird watching.

The invitation surprised me at first---I had hardly expected him to have time for at all, let alone
to intrude upon his personal hobby---but upon reflection it proved to be in keeping with his usual
mode of office hours as well as his character. The archetypal wizard holds secret knowledge, the
kind of knowledge that only passes through personal apprenticeship. Although I could have memorized
the colorings in a guide book or listened to birdsongs online, I would still lack the experiental
know-how of spotting them. It takes a master of the craft to induct an initiate bird watcher.

I didn't know what to expect. Peter O'Leary invited me along because he had a routine on those
Springtime Tuesdays he spent on the South Side, and he saw no reason to deviate from it. Bird
watching goes just as well with heavy conversation as a cappuccino, after all.

We met at 4 PM. After a short walk to the park, we slowed our pace and meandered between an asphalt
path and the muddy shoreline. In place of a wizard's staff, Peter wielded pair of binoculars which
settled almost over his glasses. Translucent green leaves poked tentatively out from mostly-naked
branches. Rib-thin squirrels rushed from trunk to trunk about some official business far too urgent
for explanation. Playing orchestra for this theater, a flock of swallows settled in the treetops,
replenishing their strength for a week or two as they made their annual pilgrimage to Canada. Peter
pointed out how to rocognize their distinctive wingtips, in between my questions about taking a year
off to study writing.
