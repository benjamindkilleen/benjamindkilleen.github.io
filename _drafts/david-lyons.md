Professor Lyons possessed the sort of casual self-importance of which only a
consulting-attorney-turned-underpaid-professor is capable. He taught "Classics of Social and
Political Thought" to a baker's dozen twenty-somethings every quarter, and he loved it. He had
elbow patches on his jacket. His favorite movie was *The Big Lebowski*. Every day, he carried a
leather messenger bag stuffed with graded papers, his syllabi, that day's reading, and cans of
green La Croix, which he drank periodically throughout the class while one or another "that kid"
spouted just their opinion, man -- as if the La Croix lent him willpower to listen.

The students in my section were ill-prepared for the likes of Prof. Lyons. We had just spent the
Winter quarter under the tutelage of an easygoing Indian man who brought coffee and donuts to class
and seldom bothered with who had actually done the reading. Naturally, we loved him. Although no
one ever intended to skip a single sentence of Rousseau, very often Analysis midterms or modul UN
prep had higher priority in terms of long-term effect. However, the trouble started late in the
quarter, when almost everyone had taken advantage of the kind man's leniency, and an awkward
silence stretched for thirty seconds or more after he asked "So, what is the Third Estate?" to no
avail.

<!-- It was sometimes necessary to skim Hobbes' -->
<!-- *Leviathan* in the twenty minutes left for breakfast, downing several cups of coffee after turning -->
<!-- in a programming assignment at two o'clock that morning, and pray that someone else could make up -->
<!-- the dearth of conversation. This worked well enough, once or twice. -->

The kind man almost always answered his own question, a fact which everyone knew but didn't stop us
from squirming with fear that he would call on someone. He never did. At the time, I was always
grateful, but afterward I wondered whether the man did us a disservice. His teaching was
unobtrusive -- on our minds as well as our priorities -- and so we learned comparatively
little. Here, I have referred to him as "the kind man" because his name now escapes my
recollection.

But I remember the name of David Lyons.

On the first day of class, Prof. Lyons informed us that he believed in fairness, and since
propriety dictated that he go by his title, we should go by ours. Thus, for three hours a week, I
would be "Mister Killeen," not "Benjamin." Likewise, I would come to know my classmates almost
exclusively as "Mister Tyler" or "Miss Bell," et cetera, requiring the slightly awkward
exchange of given names on the instances we passed each other outside class.

Prof. Lyons' syllabus contained some irregularities. Unlike his predecessor, he intended to cold
call everyone, based on the assigned reading, whenever he felt the conversation lull. He might ask
about eh importance of associateions in Tocqueville or what Nietsche meant by master morality and
its connections to slave morality. If the answer failed to impress, he said, he reserved the right
to ask anyone to leave and not not come back until they had done the reading. He never exercised
this right to its full extent -- actually tossing someone out -- since the fear of such humiliation
more than sufficed as motivation to prioritize the reading over the Wednesday Bar Night, for
example. However, I remember one occasion where he came very close. The poor student grasped at
straws while Lyons prompted his supposedly faulty memory (faulty as opposed to never-filled), all
the while claiming that he couldn't keep his thoughts straight because he had read the passage so
late at night. Maybe he was telling the truth, or maybe he never touched the reading, but Lyons
only cold-called him because he noticed a lack of participation. As he failed, more than once, to
identify even one reasonable definition of relative surplus value (in the context of Marx), a deep
sense of dread settled over his empathetic but nevertheless unhelpful comrades, too well aware that
on another morning they might have been just as unlucky.

I remember Prof. Lyons' last question as if he burned it into my brain. "Mr. Daniels," he said. "I'm
going to ask you this, and I trust you'll answer honestly. Did you do the reading?"

"Yes," said Mr. Daniels, but his tone of voice sounded unsure, as if he asked "Yes?" rather than
asserted it.

The professor appeared not to notice. "All right then," he said, and he opened the question to the
room.

Prof. Lyons viewed his syllabus not so much as a guide for students to do well in his class but
rather as a social contract, which all of us agreed to by registering for the course. The contract
facilitated the kind of conversation Prof. Lyons wanted to lead, and he enforced it rigorously. I
remember one occasion where Ms. Bell disagreed strongly with Marx's position on some issue, perhaps
that an object's value depends on the labor that goes into its production, and wished to discuss
the merits of that definition. After several attempts to redirect the conversation, Prof.~Lyons
reached into his messenger bag, withdrew a copy of the syllabus, and got up from his
chair. Ms. Bell kept speaking. Lyons marched around the table to her seat, which was just next to
mine, and laid the syllabus in front of her.

He pointed to a specific paragraph. "Read that," he said, interrupting her in mid-sentence, "and
if, after reading it, you still feel that your question adds to this discussion, I will be happy to
address it."

I could see the paragraph he pointed to. I couldn't help but read it alongside Ms. Bell, while
Prof. Lyons returned to his seat. It read:

> All of the texts we will read this quarter come from times very different from the present. As a
> result, the authors of these texts will make at least some claims with which you will no doubt
> disagree. When that happens, keep in mind that all the texts we will read this quarter contain
> some of the most important thoughts the human race has ever produced. Consequently, when
> disagreements between an author and you arise, try to understand (1) why an author has made the
> claim with which you disagree, (2) the broader purpose or purposes the author might be seeking to
> accomplish by making that claim, (3) what is at stake in both that claim and your disagreement
> with it, and (4) the weaknesses and limits of your own position. The more honest you are with
> yourself on this last point, the greater the benefit you will derive from our readings.

At length, the conversation moved on. When she spoke again, after some time, Ms. Bell did not raise
the same complaint.

Over the quarter, I got the sense that Prof. Lyons cared more deeply about imparting some sense of
truth on his students than about the particular content he was teaching. I do not mean "truths,"
such as those particular truths that Marx or Tocqueville put forth, but "truth" as a concept in of
itself: the idea that some positions are inherently correct, others are wrong, and still others can
be argued. Recognizing these categories is difficult. Yet Lyons clearly considered it a much more
crucial skill than the crucial skill than explaining anything John Stuart Mill had to say in *On
Liberty*. Often, he quoted the line from his favorite movie, "That's just your opinion, man,"
sometimes ironically, sometimes directed toward himself, and sometimes as a gentle reminder that we
might be wrong.

Of course, David Lyons himself had some very strong opinions. In "Guidelines for Written Work," a
separate document which he distributed alongsied the syllabus, Prof. Lyons listed several
"contemporary barbarisms" of modern writing, which would lower our final grade by one third if they
appeared in any essay. These included the word "impact" used for anything other than "the action of
one body striking another," and "proactive", which makes one sound like a management consultant
trying to fit more syllables into every word. Plain, honest "active" works just as well. He also
disliked words like "incentivize" and "problematize," which "add nothing to the English language"
and "instead tend to rob the language of other useful words and reduce the tools we have available
for thinking about the world."

I imagine Prof. Lyons would object to my characterizing these requirements as opinions. Indeed, I
believe that following them makes me a better writer. Yet the distinction between fact and "just
your opinion, man" illustrates the kind of truth that Prof. Lyons cared so deeply about. Over the
objections of his students, many of whom felt that "impact" worked just fine as a synonym for
"effect," he imposed his own opinion because he could support it. He had many years of experience,
both in academia and outside it, and offered the appendix of George Orwell's *1984* as the basis
for his "Guidelines." It is difficult to argue with someone who has Orwell on their side.

A different section of the Guidelines offers a summary of David Lyons's philosophy on truth. At
least, it speaks of the truth insofar as it can be argued. He writes:

> Avoid unfounded assertions. Occasionally students will simply claim that the world in which we
> live, especially human life, is a certain way and then proceed to write a paper as though that
> assumption were true.  One problem with this approach is that most really interesting claims
> about human life can be contested.  Accordingly, when you feel tempted to write a statement like
> “all human beings yearn for [insert nebulous value here],” ask yourself at least three
> questions. First, how do I know such a claim is true? Second, might there be evidence that runs
> counter to my claim?  Third ... what do I mean by [nebulous value]? You might then find yourself
> highlighting the text in question and hitting “delete.” There is no shame in that.

Prof. Lyons reviled weak opinions. This is not to say he never had any, I should think, but rather
that he worked hard to strengthen or remove them. He constructed his positions out of more atomic
truths, such as what Hume actually wrote, and sought out additional arguments to test against his
own. Thus, one could hardly say to David Lyons, "Yeah, well, that's just your opinion, man,"
because it was seldom just *his* and never *just* an opinion.

On the other hand, David Lyons readily admitted when multiple arguments made sense, even if they
contradicted one another. On the last day of class, the assigned reading consisted of neither Marx
nor Nietszhe, not even Hannah Arendt. Instead, we discussed the graphic novel *Watchmen,* by Alan
Moore.

"So," Prof. Lyons began. "Who is the hero of Watchmen?"

This was the essay prompt for that day. It was deceptively open-ended, with any number of possible
answers. Should one choose Dr. Manhattan, the blue man with god-like power to manipulate matter?
What about Ozymandius, who undoubtedly saved the most lives but sacrificed millions in the
process. Should a hero believe in right and wrong? If so, then the black-and-white Rorshach stands
alone on his principles.

Ultimately, the choice depended on one's definition of "hero," but that didn't mean that every
choice was reasonable. We would be graded on the soundness of our argument. Thus, Prof. Lyons urged
us not to argue on behalf of Edward Blake, the amoral vigilante with little regard for human life,
whose grisly murder paints the opening pages of "Watchmen" red. Edward Blake was not the hero. Any
opinion that argued as much would likely fall short of the high standard by which David Lyons
estimated truth. That is to say: reasoning.

Opinions based on such a firm foundation are not so easily dismissed as *the dude*'s oft-repeated
abnegation would like to assert. The choice of *Watchmen*'s hero was definitely up for debate, as
most matters opinion are, but that didn't make every position debatable. No one claimed the
comedian as their hero. Moreover, no one felt so strongly about their own position that they were
unwilling to adopt someone else's definitions, if only for the sake of argument. Thus, we reached a
closer approximation of truth, on that hot Tuesday morning on May, while David Lyons listened
thoughtfully, all the while drinking his La Croix.
