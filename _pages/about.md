A Ph.D. Student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), I am interested in intelligent
surgical systems based on explorative computer vision and deep reinforcement learning that directly
improve patient outcomes. I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented
Environments ([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Mathias
Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io/) and the Computational Interaction and Robotics
Laboratory ([CIRL](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/)), led by [Gregory
D. Hager](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/hager/).

I have (first/co)authored peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. For a complete
list of my publications, please see my [CV](https://benjamindkilleen.com/markdown-cv/) or [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QX7AvxUAAAAJ).

In 2019, I completed my undergraduate education at the [University of
Chicago](https://uchicago.edu), receiving a B.A. in Computer Science with Honors and a minor in
Physics, advised by [Gordon Kindlmann](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/). I have also been
fortunate enough to intern with [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/) under
[Geoffrey Burr](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-gwburr), [Epic
Systems](https://www.epic.com/) in Cognitive Computing, and [Intuitive
Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us) under Omid Mohareri.

In my spare time, I pursue creative writing. For some recent examples, please see [my
blog](https://benjamindkilleen.com/blog/).
