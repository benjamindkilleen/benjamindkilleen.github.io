Actually, it may have been a modest bucket hat, but the man so much resembled a wizard himself that the gray conical cap seems more likely in my mind.</p><p>Peter, as he preferred to be called, spent Tuesdays on campus. He taught a number of courses in creative writing, including the succinctly titled <em>Wizards</em>, and the much beloved <em>Intro to Genres: Science Fiction</em>. Among undergrads, <em>Wizards</em> and <em>Sci-fi</em> had an awe-inducing reputation. I just barely managed to secure a seat in both, first by carefully planning my schedule (second years get priority for the arts) and later by emailing Peter two minutes after classes dropped to check if any seats had opened up. Eventually one did.</p><p>Peter’s core courses were highly sought-after but not for the usual reasons. Already burnt out pre-meds and comp-sci majors preferred to fill our arts requirement with something somewhat lighter. We felt we had insufficient energy, between lab reports and breadth-first-search and figuring out what Hobbes meant by the “State of Nature,” to take on an unnecessary challenge. <em>Art History</em>, as an alternative, reportedly involved mere rote memorization; the drama department offerings had an almost legendary dearth of weekly readings. <em>Wizards</em>, on the other hand, assigned a different book for every Tuesday, on top of writing assignments for workshop. Yet Peter’s waitlist was never empty.</p><p>Perhaps, this was because the pre-meds and comp-sci majors desperately needed a class like <em>Wizards</em> or <em>Sci-fi</em>, demanding though they were. We needed to create a space, within the highly structured world of academia, for something we loved. <em>Wizards</em> made room to think about old sages with walking staffs and pointy hats with the same rigor as delta-epsilon proofs on dusty chalkboards. While <em>Intermediate Mechanics</em> introduced first order constraints, <em>Sci-fi</em> gave us free reign of the cosmos. Peter welcomed these students warmly, perhaps understanding what drove us to take his course better than we understood ourselves. At the beginning of the quarter, he had all of us introduce ourselves: who we were, where we were from, and what we studied. By the end, he always wore a delighted grin at the diversity of majors in attendance.</p><p>In both classes, the professor conducted on-on-one meetings with his students. Lacking an office on campus, he invited us to stroll around the Midway, a twenty-five or thirty minute circuit, in spite of the purportedly unpleasant Chicago winter. The chill added urgency to our conversations. He would apologize for the snow before he asked about our hometowns, our novels-in-progress. As we shivered in the wind, he listened to our answers. Peter O’Leary possessed that rare quality, which is so common among authors and yet so rare among professors, of being an attentive listener. For young authors, used to scrawling their manuscripts with the bedroom door closed and the curtains drawn, late at night, after the folks fell asleep in front of Netflix box, and the dog stretched languidly across that patch of hardwood floor above the boiler, for us his engagement felt unreal. Also, it meant the world.</p><p>For final projects, Peter gave two options. First, we could polish our workshop pieces and assemble a portfolio, which was typical of creative writing courses. Alternatively, he encouraged us to submit personal projects or partial manuscripts, as long as they were somewhat related to the course material. The single-spaced pages of constructive, <em>usable</em> feedback which resulted from these submissions are, I imagine, more scrutinized by his students than lines of the Illiad by classical scholars.</p><p>Having written various pieces of a novel that Winter quarter, I decided to submit a first chapter for the final project. In the excerpt below, Peter identifies the strengths in my writing, as he did for every student, before he moved onto some pointed criticisms, which I will omit—although there were many—for the sake of brevity, generality, and some non-negligible insecurity.</p><blockquote><p>The things that work avidly in this chapter are many. Some of the things that really stand out to me are the energetic opening sequence, which has an absorbing cinematic quality. Philip Pullman, in his essays, regularly cites something he learned from novelist, playwright, and director David Mamet, who says the question he always asks himself when writing something is “Where do I put the camera?” He means not to treat his writing as a preview to a screenplay but to be thinking always about visual lines of sight and what the reader will be seeing as they read. In the opening of the chapter, it’s compellingly easy to visualize what’s happening because you seem instinctively to know where to put the camera. — Peter O’Leary</p></blockquote><p>I imagine such poignant feedback took some time to write, but Peter understood its value. His notes inspired me to keep working on the novel, which at that time was a daunting prospect. I had “more serious” matters demanding my energy, what with comp-sci research and graduate school looming, and the little I’d written consisted of amorphous fragments not necessarily worth investing in. Peter O’Leary encouraged me that they were. He understood, perhaps, that the pre-meds or comp-sci majors like me needed an extra push to pursue something we valued if it was outside our chosen field. It took someone like him, telling us, in order to believe we should.</p><p><img src="/images/midway.jpeg" alt="The Midway in winter." /></p></section><footer class="page__meta"><p class="page__taxonomy"> <strong><i class="fa fa-fw fa-tags" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tags: </strong> <span itemprop="keywords"> <a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/tags/#chicago" class="page__taxonomy-item" rel="tag">Chicago</a> </span></p></footer><section class="page__share"><h4 class="page__share-title">Share on</h4><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/10/how-to-hold-office-hours/" class="btn btn--twitter" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/10/how-to-hold-office-hours/" class="btn btn--facebook" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/10/how-to-hold-office-hours/" class="btn btn--linkedin" title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> LinkedIn</span></a></section><nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/08/how-to-go-casting/" class="pagination--pager" title="How to go Casting ">Previous</a> <a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/11/how-to-have-an-opinion" class="pagination--pager" title="How to Have an Opinion ">Next</a></nav></div></article><div class="page__related"><h4 class="page__related-title">You May Also Enjoy</h4><div class="grid__wrapper"><div class="grid__item"><article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h2 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2021/08/roadlocked/" rel="permalink">Roadlocked </a></h2><p class="page__meta"><i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> 9 minute read</p><p class="page__date"><strong><i class="fa fa-fw fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Published:</strong> <time datetime="2021-08-24T00:00:00-04:00">August 24, 2021</time></p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>“How do you keep yourself from just flooring it?” <strong><a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2021/08/roadlocked/" rel="permalink"> Read more</a></strong></p></p></article></div><div class="grid__item"><article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h2 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2021/03/how-to-take-the-train/" rel="permalink">How to Take the Train </a></h2><p class="page__meta"><i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> 5 minute read</p><p class="page__date"><strong><i class="fa fa-fw fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Published:</strong> <time datetime="2021-03-10T00:00:00-05:00">March 10, 2021</time></p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>The Amtrak overlooks a lot of cornfields in between Chicago and St. Louis.

It had the proportions of a dance studio or a chemistry lab – although it was neither – and inhabited the same basement hallway as the weight room and the lockers, containing neither weights nor changing areas. Two collapsible pitching cages hinted at one function, tucked against the near side wall, but for the most part their rolled-up turf served as a convenient bench for changing out of tennis shoes, not in use. Above these, gray steel beams supported the corrugated ceiling, covered in an insulating foam. The foam was peppered with tiny black dots, which once served as the only entertainment during a mandatory screening of “Your Body,” that the Health teacher showed, using a TV cart as wide as the doorway, well-equipped with both video-cassette and DVD players, minus one remote. We sat on the floor, since the makeshift classroom had little in the way of seating. It was not, after all, really a classroom. <strong><a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/12/how-to-get-pinned/" rel="permalink"> Read more</a></strong></p></p></article></div><div class="grid__item"><article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h2 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="https://benjamindkilleen.com/posts/2020/11/how-to-have-an-opinion" rel="permalink">How to Have an Opinion </a></h2><p class="page__meta"><i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> 13 minute read</p><p class="page__date"><strong><i class="fa fa-fw fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Published:</strong> <time datetime="2020-11-10T00:00:00-05:00">November 10, 2020</time></p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Professor Lyons possessed the sort of casual self-importance which only former consulting attorneys and underpaid professors are capable of.
