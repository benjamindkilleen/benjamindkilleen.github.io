<!-- Prof. Lyons used to be a consulting attorney. Now he taught "Classics of Social and Political -->
<!-- Thought" to a baker's dozen twenty-somethings. -->

Professor Lyons possessed the sort of casual self-importance of which only a
consulting-attorney-turned-underpaid-professor is capable. He taught "Classics of Social and
Political Thought" to a baker's dozen twenty-somethings every quarter, and he loved it. He had
elbow patches on his jacket. His favorite movie was *The Big Lebowski*. Every day, he carried a
leather messenger bag stuffed with graded papers, his syllabi, that day's reading, and cans of
green La Croix, which he drank periodically throughout the class while one or another "that kid"
spouted just their opinion, man -- as if the La Croix lent him willpower to listen.

The students in my section were ill-prepared for the likes of Prof. Lyons. We had just spent the
Winter quarter under the tutelage of an easygoing Indian man who brought coffee and donuts to class
and seldom bothered with who had actually done the reading. Naturally, we loved him. Although no
one ever intended to skip a single sentence of Rousseau, very often Analysis midterms or modul UN
prep had higher priority in terms of long-term effect. However, the trouble started late in the
quarter, when almost everyone had taken advantage of the kind man's leniency, and an awkward
silence stretched for thirty seconds or more after he asked "So, what is the Third Estate?" to no
avail.

<!-- It was sometimes necessary to skim Hobbes' -->
<!-- *Leviathan* in the twenty minutes left for breakfast, downing several cups of coffee after turning -->
<!-- in a programming assignment at two o'clock that morning, and pray that someone else could make up -->
<!-- the dearth of conversation. This worked well enough, once or twice. -->

The kind man almost always answered his own question, a fact which everyone knew but didn't stop us
from fidgeting in our seats for fear of being called on. We never were. At the time, I was always
grateful, but afterward I wondered whether the man did us a disservice. His teaching was
unobtrusive -- on our minds as well as our priorities -- and so we learned comparatively
little. Now, I call him "kind man" because even his name escapes me.

I doubt I'll ever forget the name of David Lyons.

On the first day of class, Prof. Lyons informed us that he believed in fairness, and since
propriety dictated that he go by his title, we should go by ours. Thus, for three hours a week, I
would be "Mister Killeen," not "Benjamin." Likewise, I would come to know my classmates almost
exclusively as "Mister Tyler" or "Miss Bell," et cetera, requiring the slightly awkward
exchange of given names on the instances we passed each other outside class.

Prof. Lyons' syllabus contained some irregularities. Unlike his predecessor, he intended to cold
call everyone, based on the assigned reading, whenever he felt the conversation lull. He might ask
about eh importance of associateions in Tocqueville or what Nietsche meant by master morality and
its connections to slave morality. If the answer failed to impress, he said, he reserved the right
to ask anyone to leave and not not come back until they had done the reading. He never exercised
this right to its full extent -- actually tossing someone out -- since the fear of such humiliation
more than sufficed as motivation to prioritize the reading over the Wednesday Bar Night, for
example. However, I remember one occasion where he came very close. The poor student grasped at
straws while Lyons prompted his supposedly faulty memory (faulty as opposed to never-filled), all
the while claiming that he couldn't keep his thoughts straight because he had read the passage so
late at night. Maybe he was telling the truth, or maybe he never touched the reading, but Lyons
only cold-called him because he noticed a lack of participation. As he failed, more than once, to
identify even one reasonable definition of relative surplus value (in the context of Marx), a deep
sense of dread settled over his empathetic but nevertheless unhelpful comrades, too well aware that
on another morning they might have been just as unlucky.

I remember Prof. Lyons' last question as if he burned it into my brain. "Mr. Daniels," he said. "I'm
going to ask you this, and I trust you'll answer honestly. Did you do the reading?"

"Yes," said Mr. Daniels, but his tone of voice sounded unsure, as if he asked "Yes?" rather than
asserted it.

The professor appeared not to notice. "All right then," he said, and he opened the question to the
room.

Prof. Lyons viewed his syllabus not so much as a guide for students to do well in his class but
rather as a social contract, which all of us agreed to by registering for the course. I remember an
occasion where Miss Bell disagreed strongly with Marx's position on one issue, perhaps that an
object's value depends on the labor that went into its production, and wished to discuss the merits
of that definition. After several attempts to redirect the conversation, Prof.~Lyons reached into
his messenger bag, withdrew a copy of the syllabus, and got up from his chair, interrupting the
Miss Bell in the middle of her sentence. He marched around the table to her seat, which was just
next to mine, and laid the syllabus in front of her.

He pointed to a particular paragraph. "Read that," he said, "and if, after reading it, you still
feel that your question is valid, I will be happy to discuss it."

The paragraph had to do with the type of discussion Prof.~Lyons wanted to facilitate. Without
accepting, at least for the sake of argument, the definition of value that Marx put forth, there
was no way to understand the larger point Marx tries to make. Ms. Bell asserted that Marx was
simply wrong, and in doing so she had broken the social contract.

Prof. Lyons returned to his seat, and the conversation resumed. When she spoke again, after some
time, Ms. Bell did not raise the same complaint.

Over the quarter, I got the sense that Prof. Lyons cared more deeply about imparting some sense of
truth on his students than about the particular content he was teaching. I do not mean "truths,"
such as those particular truths that Marx or Tocqueville put forth, but "truth" as a concept in of
itself: the idea that some position are inherently correct, others are wrong, and still others can
be argued. Recognizing these categories is difficult. Yet Lyons clearly considered it a much more
crucial skill than the crucial skill than explaining anything John Stuart Mill had to say in *On
Liberty*. Often, he quoted the line from his favorite movie, "That's just your opinion, man,"
sometimes ironically, sometimes directed toward himself, and sometimes as a gentle reminder that we
might be wrong.

Of course, David Lyons himself had some very strong opinions. In "Guidelines for Written Work," a
separate document which he distributed alongsied the syllabus, Prof. Lyons listed several
"contemporary barbarisms" of modern writing, which would lower our final grade by one third if they
appeared in any essay. These included the word "impact" used for anything other than "the action
of one body striking another," and "proactive", which makes one sound like a management consultant
trying to fit more syllables into every word. He also disliked words like "incentivize" and
"problematize," which "add nothing to the English language" and "instead tend to rob the language
of other useful words and reduce the tools we have available for thinking about the world."

I imagine Prof. Lyons would object to my characterizing these requirements as opinions. Indeed, I
believe that following them makes me a better writer. Yet the distinction between fact and "just
your opinion, man" illustrates the kind of truth that Prof. Lyons cared so deeply about. Over the
objections of his students, many of whom felt that "impact" worked just fine as a synonym for
"effect," he imposed his own opinion because he could support it. He had many years of experience,
both in academia and outside it, and offered the appendix of George Orwell's *1984* as the basis
for his "Guidelines." It is difficult to argue with someone who has Orwell on their side.

A different section of the "Guidelines" offers a summary of David Lyons's philosophy on truth. At
least, it speaks of the truth insofar as it can be argued about. He writes:

> Avoid unfounded assertions. Occasionally students will simply claim that the world in which we
> live, especially human life, is a certain way and then proceed to write a paper as though that
> assumption were true.  One problem with this approach is that most really interesting claims
> about human life can be contested.  Accordingly, when you feel tempted to write a statement like
> “all human beings yearn for [insert nebulous value here],” ask yourself at least three
> questions. First, how do I know such a claim is true? Second, might there be evidence that runs
> counter to my claim?  Third ... what do I mean by [nebulous value]? You might then find yourself
> highlighting the text in question and hitting “delete.” There is no shame in that.








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Winter quarter, my Classics seminar enjoyed an easygoing professor brought coffee and donuts
and seldom bothered with who had actually done the reading. We loved him. Although no one ever
*intended* to skip a single sentence of Rousseau, very often Analysis midterms or model UN prep had
higher priority. It was sometimes necessary to let the readings slide, and this professor was very
forgiving. However, I cannot remember the kind man's name.

I cannot remember the kind man's name. I *definitely* remember David Lyons.

Although we never *intentionally* skipped a single sentence of Rousseau,
sometimes classtime arrived before we realized.

David Lyons carried himself with the kind of casual self-importance that only underpaid professors
can. According to rumor, he could have earned a significant income at a consulting firm, but
instead he taughed twenty-year-olds about Democracy in America and what Karl Marx actually meant by
"opiate of the masses." The decision didn't seem driven by academic ambitions, at least not
then. Rather, it was as if the greener grasses of high-roll consulting waited just beyond the
quarter, and he continually committed himself to one more ten-week course out of the sense that his
short term activity could little detriment his long term prosperity, and in the meantime he had
minds to mold.

Prof. Lyons gave the impression of a lawyer or perhaps an old-fashioned banker. He carred a leather
messenger bag always neatly organized with a portfolio of graded papers, his syllabus, the day's
reading, and two cans of green-flavored La Croix, which he drank while students spouted their
opinions. Once, he forgot the sparkling water. His wife graciously dropped by so that he needn't go
unquenched. The class hardly skipped a beat, despite this interruption, and he merely said, "Go
on," to the underclassmen who had been speaking.

In the Winter quarter, our class enjoyed an easygoing Indian professor who seldom bothered with who
had done the reading and brought everyone coffee on the last day of class. This kind man's name now
escapes me.

David Lyons, on the other hand, let us know that he was a different kind of professor. He stated in
class and on the syllabus that he reserved the right cold call any one of us, asking about the
importance of associations in Tocqueville or what Nietsche meant by master morality. If our answers
failed to impress, he said, we didn't deserve to sit in his class. He never exercised this right to
its full extent, actually tossing someone out, with the fear of such humiliation being more than
enough to make sure most everyone came prepared. However, on one occasion he came very close. The
growing dread, as this poor student grasped at straws while Lyons prompted his supposedly slipshod
memory (slipshod as opposed to empty), made my skin crawl. To hear this student, who may or may not
have merely done the reading too late in the evening, as they claimed, fail to identify again and
again even one reasonable definition of relative surplus value, unaided in the intermittent
silences by empathetic but helpless comrades, too well aware that on another morning they might
have been just as unluck, and to hear David Lyons' ultimate question, in that moment, still stands
out in my memory

"Mr. Daniels," he said, addressing the student by his title, "I'm going to ask you this, and I
trust you'll answer honestly. Did you do the reading?"

"Yes?" said Mr. Daniels, with a tone that tilted upward at the end, making the single word a
question. It was as if he asked, by lying so poorly, whever he might exact pity from the merciless
Lyons.

The professor nodded. "All right then," he said, and he opened the question to the rest of us.
