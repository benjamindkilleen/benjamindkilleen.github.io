When I asked Dad if he could build a treehouse, I didn't think he would actually agree. Being only
nine years old, I underestimated the fragile male ego and the affinity for power tools that would
drive my father, who did _not_ work in construction, to spend an entire summer with his newly
acquired table saw. And me. I also helped.

Our house in Madison had two trees. The first was a twisted thing with a convenient perch for
nine-year-old climbers which might have supported a "tree fort," but not a house. A tree fort, of
course, consists of no more than two planks of wood affixed to the highest possible branch with a
bunch of rusty nails, but on unfilled afternoons it can become a starliner in the Orion Nebula or
[crenelations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Battlement) atop medieval towers. Alas, though tree forts
stimulate the imagination, they result in just as many broken necks as future novelists, and so Dad
ruled out the twisted tree. It was also in the front yard, which disqualified any augmentation from
the get-go on aesthetic grounds. Mom said so.

That left the walnut tree. This arboreal nuissance occupied the very back corner of our property and
arguably belonged just as much to our next-door neighbor as it did to us. Both households suffered
the endless jetsam
