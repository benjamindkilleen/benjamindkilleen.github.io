Nine months out of the year, most people called it the multipurpose room. In the basement, off the
hall from the cafeteria, in the same corridor as the weight room and the lockers, the room had the
proportions of a dance studio or a wine cellar. It was neither. In fact, it felt vaguely
purposeless for those nine months. Collapsible batting cages hinted at one function, tucked against
the near wall. Their rolled-up green offered a convenient bench for changing in and out of tennis
shoes, as long as you could keep your balance. On the ceiling, an insulating foam covered gray
steel beams, peppered with tiny black dots which once served as the only entertainment during those
mandatory screenings of "Your Body," that the Health teacher had to show, using a TV cart as wide
as the doorway and well-equipped with both video-casette and DVD players, minus one remote. I
remember trying to count the speckles, bored.

The left and back walls of the multipurpose room reminded everyone of its most inherent role.
Health had other classrooms and the batting cages could conceivably be moved elsewhere, but the
orange crash padding, bolted to the concrete of the left and back wall and seemingly out of place
between between cheap, blue-white floor tiles and low-hanging fluorescent lights between the
foam-covered beams, was permanent. In later years, the room would take on other, equally permanent
signifiers of its primary purpose: a painted-orange "champions corner" where every practice ended
with a self-directed set of fifty push-ups; a peg board and seven pull-up bars bolted just above
the padding, at different heights; and in the middle of these instruments of physical conditioning
a hand-painted mural of the wrestling team's logo emblazoned with our unofficial name, "Currahee
Wrestling."

The logo didn't say, "Statesmen," which was our official school mascot. No one complained. The
Statesman was an abstract mascot whose signature top hat and twirling baton wouldn't have inspired
fish to swim. We didn't identify with it. We didn't don "Statesmen Wrestling" hoodies like plates
of armor against the appraising glances of the Such-and-Such High School Eagles, Wolves, and
Wildcats that populate every corner of America in place of their apex namesakes. And we certainly
didn't let loose that vague, unspirited monicker like a wild war cry when nothing else could
capture the primal blend of cameraderie, pride, and dread which descended after weigh-ins. Instead,
we grunted "Currahee" in the deepest voice that adolescent boys could muster, and everyone who
heard us wondered what it meant.

To this day, I don't exactly know what inspired Coach to change the name, separating us somewhat
from the other sports at Webster. Perhaps he objected to the gendered nature of the term, which
would have excluded our female members in spirit if not in practice. I do not know. Perhaps the
vaguely nationalistic flavor of a "state's man" rubbed him the wrong way, possessing too large a
meaning for young wrestlers to carry with them on the mat. Most likely, however, Coach James Lemay
just liked "Currahee." He chose the Cherokee word based on an episode of *Band of Brothers*, where
the 101st Airborne runs three miles up, three miles down Currahee mountain. It translates as "We
stand alone together," a fitting motto for a division of paratroopers who dropped behind enemy
lines with no support except each other. James Lemay wanted it to fit his wrestling team as well.

On the first day of practice, sometimes after the regular football season but before the end of the
post-season, the multipurpose room became the wrestling room. In that yearly ritual, which
necessarily took place before any other, we dragged out the mats from the storage closet at the
back of the room and taped them down, to remain there for the duration of the season. This was no
simple matter. Each mat weighed more than seven freshmen and required extraordinary coordination of
mostly new recruits to maneuver through the doorway. The upperclassmen, eager to get started,
directed the twenty or thirty younger boys and, in my years, a few fearless young women.

Eventually, we finished the mats. We shed our shoes and applied antibacterial foam, which was
universally required, to arm and leg and face and neck. For warmup, we jogged for ten minutes in a
tight circle around the room, during which exercise the coaches, the upperclassmen, and the
occasional daring freshman shouted, "Ten, ten, and ten."

Instantly, everybody dropped, as if the coach or boy or girl had been a commanding officer of our
namesake paratroopers announcing incoming fire, and fell into ten push-ups, ten crunches, and ten
v-ups. We did them quickly. No one wanted to be the last one with his back on the mat, still
counting dots on the ceiling.

After warmup, one of the wrestlers led the stretch. Ten seconds touch your toes. Ten seconds arm
circles. Down on the ground and crack your back, then bridge up on the back of your head. Keep that
head up. Neck stretch. Roll it out.

"All right, circle up," Lemay said when we had finished. By this he meant gather in a tight
semicircle in the center of the mat, either standing or sitting at attention, on one knee. You
weren't supposed to sit at ease, on your butt. Some of the freshmen didn't know. They quickly
learned by imitation.

James Lemay stood in the center. The man had a commanding presence without really trying. His
workout shirts were never big enough for his biceps, which were tattooed with some Chinese
characters a stylized Boba Fett, all in black. He had a bald head and a round face, cleanly
shaven. Smiling broadly at the number of new faces, the man looked almost cherubic.

Lemay had a short speech on the first day. The longer speeches would come later, about pushing
through and eating right -- not starving ourselves but not wolfing down a plate of brownies the
night before a meet either -- and about the mentality of wrestling. The longer speeches always had
to do with mentality. But early on, short speeches left time for long conditioning, which was more
important.

"This is a hard sport," he told us. "And every year, I ask myself if I should go a little easier on
you guys. Maybe then more of you would stick around. But then I would be doing you a disservice. If
I don't push you harder than you can push yourselves, that's how you get pinned. And then you're
the guy with his back on the mat still staring up at the ceiling while the other guy is getting his
hand raised. Or girl."

The upperclassmen nodded along with the speech, while the freshmen like me wondered if we should be
here. Before that Fall, I had never wrestled before. I didn't play any sport, except for springtime
baseball. But every kid plays baseball in St. Louis. I was awkward, bookish, and still carried
fifteen pounds of baby fat underneath a curly mop of reddish brown hair which could have been a
bird's nest. I really had no business stepping foot in that single-purpose room at all, except
perhaps for Health class. By the end of the week, I thought, I would be one of the kids that quit.

At the end of his speech, Lemay went over the essential information. Practice started at 3:00
P.M.. It ended at 5:30, but we should shower after, so plan on being done by 6 P.M.. Saturday
practices were optional, but unless you had a family reunion somewhere in Kansas, you should
probably be there. No ride? Run. Too far? Coach or one of the upperclassmen would come and pick you
up and shake you out of bed if necessary. Lemay didn't want anyone left out.

<!-- TODO: description of the workouts, maybe when meets started. Continuing to lose. -->

Sometimes Lemay had a beard, and sometimes he kept his face clean. When the man shaved, he had a
youthful, almost cherubic face that was difficult to reconcile with the rest of him. Bearded, he
looked like the Godfather's bodyguard: intimidating. Every November, he transitioned from the
former state to the latter, beginning with the first practice and lasting until the beginning of
dual meets. Even then, he wstill wouldn't shave until the Currahee wrestlers carried home a victory
for the team, at which point every member of the varsity roster took turns with the razor, while
Lemay leaned over a trash can, his face covered in Barbasol. Most of us had barely started shaving
ourselves, but he trusted us all the same.
<!-- TODO: make clear that I wasn't on varsity when this happened the first year. -->

I still can't explain what made me one of those who heard Lemay's longer speeches and watched the
upperclassmen shave his beard, instead of those who decided wrestling wasn't for them. For some
reason I couldn't quit. Meets scared me. Tournaments were terrifying. I got pinned in the first
seven or eight matches I wrestled. <!-- TODO: something about spending time dreading when I
would next have to wrestle -->

<!-- TODO: need a way to finish that's not so disjointed. -->
Every wrestler stands alone on the mat, but unlike swimmers and runners and others who compete for
individual medals, we can never practice on our own. Drilling moves requires a partner, preferably
one with roughly equal weight and skill, who ultimately teaches you more about a given move than
the instructor. The sport of wrestling, as I experienced it, depended on being part of a group.








<!-- The rest of that practice only reinforced my suspicion. Nobody entered that room with the physical -->
<!-- fitness to last six minutes on the mat, but within three weeks they would have to. Coach knew -->
<!-- that. He also knew that roughly half of the newcomers, along with a handful of upperclassmen, would -->
<!-- quit before the second week. That was all right. He would rather have a dedicated roster than a -->
<!-- full one. -->

<!-- I met Lemay on a Tuesday afternoon. The announcements that Monday had mentioned open mats for the -->
<!-- pre-season, which piqed my interest. I don't know why. I had never wrestled before and never loved -->
<!-- sports, excepting a stubborn affection with America's favorite passtime, during which I spent -->
<!-- countless hours squinting at the batter from out in left field. I was awkward, bookish, and still -->
<!-- carried fifteen pounds of baby fat underneath a curly mop of reddish brown hair which could have -->
<!-- been a bird's nest. Theoretically, I had no business stepping foot in that alleged multipurpose -->
<!-- room at all, except perhaps for Health class. I showed up anyway. -->

<!-- I knew enough to bring workout clothes, but I had never used the changing rooms. Feeling -->
<!-- consciously out of place, I opened the first door in the corridor. -->

<!-- It was the weight room. Coach stood in the back. -->

<!-- "Hey," I said, steeling myself. "Where are the lockers?" -->

<!-- James Lemay looked up from his clipboard. Surrounded by black squat racks and rubber dumbells, he -->
<!-- was a creature in his habitat, with legs like tree trunks and a barrel-built chest. His bare arms -->
<!-- had tattoos on both biceps, some Chinese characters on one and a stylized Boba Fett on the other, -->
<!-- all in black. He had a bald head and a round face. When cleanly shaven and smiling, the man looked -->
<!-- almost cherubic. In that moment, he grinned at the prospect of a newcomer. -->

<!-- "Down the hall," he said. "On the right." -->

<!-- "Right." -->

<!-- Outside, I started to doubt myself. I didn't know anyone on the wrestling team, and I didn't know -->
<!-- there would be weight-lifting before the open mats. I considered leaving. My ride wouldn't be there -->
<!-- until 5:00, but I could hang out in the library, reading. At this point, no one would care if I -->
<!-- just left. -->

<!-- I didn't leave. I changed into my middle school gym clothes and returned to find six or seven boys -->
<!-- already warming up on stationary bikes, and one girl. I got on an elliptical. -->

<!-- This idea is pretty central to the theme, and also pretty definitive of everything in high
school, but also salient because it's pretty definitive of human nature. Now, to figure out what to
say about it... -->

<!-- TODO: need more transition to talk about this first day of the pre-season. -->

<!-- TODO: I think maybe the dip into the present is a little quick? I want to focus on that
strange decision, both to join in the first place and later not to quit. I guess this is a part of
that. The answer is some kind of stubborness, in retrospect, but really I don't know and couln't
tell you then or now. -->

<!-- Officially, we were the "Webster Groves Statesmen Wrestling Team," but the logo didn't say -->
<!-- "Statesmen Wrestling." We didn't print that ridiculous top hat and batton on our team hoodies, -->
<!-- those symbols of a mascot as uninspired as the obligatory such-and-such high school Wolves, -->
<!-- Wildcats and Tigers which populate every county of America in place of their apex namesakes. And we -->
<!-- certainly didn't let loose the gender-specific word, "Statesmen," like a wild war cry when nothing -->
<!-- else could capture that primal blend of cameraderie, pride, and dread which descended after -->
<!-- weigh-ins. Instead our wall and our hoodies and our rallying cry was "Currahee," a Cherokee word -->
<!-- which the 101st Airborne Division adopted as their motto, popularized by Tom Hanks and Steven -->
<!-- Spielberg's *Band of Brothers,* which offers this translation: "We stand alone."  -->

<!-- On the first day of practice, Coach Lemay explained his understanding of the word. "It means, 'We -->
<!-- stand alone, together,'" he said. "Currahee." -->

<!-- It was a fitting motto for a wrestling team, whose members grow more close and more comfortable -->
<!-- with each other perhaps than those of any other high school sport, but also those who stand alone -->
<!-- against another boy or girl, a stranger, who means to beat them. On the mat, no wrestler among us -->
<!-- had any help save that roar from the sidelines---not "Webster," not "Statesmen," but "Currahee." -->
<!-- (Maybe use this as a last line?)  -->


<!-- I hesitate to describe the man, in case the stereotypes about men with his appearance convey more -->
<!-- about his character than his actions, but any mention of James Lemay would be incomplete if it did -->
<!-- not convey the commanding nature of his physical presence. The man had an alpha-male gorilla's -->
<!-- chest and a dancer's gait. His massive arms had tattoos on both biceps, some Chinese characters on -->
<!-- one and a stylized Boba Fett on the other, all in black. He kept a shaved scalp and a cool head. He -->
<!-- had a temper -- it was hard not to, in that sport -- but he demonstrated how to control his anger -->
<!-- whenever it arose, a skill that stood in stark contrast to the coaches and fathers we sometimes saw -->
<!-- at other schools, chewing out the kids who got pinned. When Lemay got mad, he carried it off by -->
<!-- himself, and he came back calm. -->
