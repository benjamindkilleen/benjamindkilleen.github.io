The lake is fifteen minutes from my parent's house, a fact which comprises the bulk of its
appealing qualities. Dense thickets and collapsing mud walls encircle the water, interrupted by
abandoned camping chairs and a mossy picnic table sinking into the Missouri mud. A park pavillion
overlooks the scenery on one end. A boat ramp slowly erodes on the other.

The lake, which used to be a quarry, lies at the bottom of a river valley. After a rainstorm, the
Meramec picks up all the trash on its banks and surges into the former quarry, depositing Anheuser
Busch cans and Marlboro butts all along the shallow cover, where bass like to hide. A thick film of
grime clings to the surface. Mercury levels make the fish not-quite-edible.

My dad inherited our boat from his brother's father-in-law. "Tillie," as the old patriarch dubbed
her, comes from modest bass boat stock. She has three wooden benches and an aluminum hull, which
echoes when you bang it and scares the fish away. One bench sports a cool fisherman's swivel
chair. In her first life, Tillie was better suited to catfishing on the Mississippi, but she serves
well enough for largemouth, and my dad dislikes the bottomfeeder's taste. He fishes for the fight,
not the frying pan.

When my dad and I decide to go fishing, usually at an inconvenient time in conflict with the family
dinner, we haul Tillie out of my dad's one-car woodshop-garage and hook her to the Toyata. On the
drive, I play hip hop or alt-rock, to which my dad politely nods along, until we reach the river
valley. Sometimes we talk in the car. Sometimes we wait until we're out on the water.

To kayakers and paddle-boarders, the quarry lake has one more appealing quality, a strict
"no-gas-motor" policy. This means that our humble Tillie, so often the runt in a sea of
Bass-Pro-purebreds, is actually the top dog. She skates effortlessly from cove to cove thanks to a
foot-pedal trolling motor, powered by a car battery. Once, my dad hooked up the cables wrong, and
we couldn't figure out why we were having such a hard time getting the boat to go forward. But most
of the time, Tillie is the envy of every fishing kayak we pass. 

We were once in their shoes, with less space and greater patience to work with. It doesn't make
much difference. For all their plumage, fishermen really care about just one thing.

"Any luck?" they ask.

"Not today. You?"

"Not a bite."

The quarry lake isn't well known as any great fishing hole. In fact, the longest running joke in my
family is to call it "casting." It's only "fishing" when you catch something.

Thus my dad and I, with no tallies to compare our prowess, make a game of casting. We like to think
the game is good for fishing, but we haven't carried out any controlled experiment. The game is
simple. As we troll around the shore, we cast as close to the fallen sticks and swamped logs as we
can without getting caught. This results in many snags, few fish, and a great sense of
accomplishment.
