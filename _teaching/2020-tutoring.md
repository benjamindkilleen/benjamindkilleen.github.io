I tutor a small number of young people (middle- or high-school age) who are interested in machine
learning and computer science.

I use both borrowed and original material, some of which is available online:
- [unfinished-micrograd](https://github.com/benjamindkilleen/unfinished-micrograd), forked from
  [micrograd](github.com/karpathy/micrograd/), with essential code removed for students to
  implement.
- [numpytorch](https://github.com/benjamindkilleen/numpytorch) (private), a minimalist approach to
  backpropagation using Tensors. Based on PyTorch, uses numpy arrays. Unlike `micrograd`,
  `numpytorch` contends with the difficulties that only arise when dealing with operations on
  tensors rather than scalars. Available on request.
- [tic_tac_toe](https://github.com/benjamindkilleen/tic_tac_toe), a Q-learning agent learns to play
  tic-tac-toe in 500 lines.

I am open to students of all ages, but prerequisite knowledge of [Python](https://python.org)
and/or differential Calculus is required. If interested, please include "Tutoring" in the subject
line of your email.
