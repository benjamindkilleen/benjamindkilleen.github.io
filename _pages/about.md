A Ph.D. Student at Johns Hopkins University, I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Interests
Computationally Augmented Environments [(ARCADE)](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) research group and
the Computational Interaction and Robotics Laboratory [(CIRL)](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/). My
research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and domain generalization, focusing
on applications in robotic manipulation, medical imaging, and surgical robotics.
