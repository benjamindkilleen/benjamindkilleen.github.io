<!-- He taught "Classics of Social and Political Thought" to a -->
<!-- baker's dozen twenty-somethings every quarter, and he loved it. -->

Professor Lyons possessed the sort of casual self-importance which only former consulting attorneys
and underpaid professors are capable of. He had elbow patches on his jacket. His favorite movie was
*The Big Lebowski*. Every day, he carried a leather messenger bag stuffed with graded papers,
syllabi, that day's reading, and several cans of green La Croix, which he drank periodically
throughout the class while one or another "that kid" spouted their opinion -- as if the
Wisconsonian sparkling water lent him willpower to listen.

The students in my section were ill-prepared for the likes of Prof. Lyons. We had just spent the
Winter quarter under the tutelage of an easygoing Indian man who brought coffee and donuts to class
and seldom bothered with who had actually done the reading. Naturally, we loved him. Although no
one ever intended to skip a single sentence of Rousseau, very often Analysis midterms or modul UN
prep had higher priority in terms of long-term import. By about seventh week, however, almost
everyone had gotten used to the kind man's leniency, and an awkward silence stretched for thirty
seconds or more after he asked, "What is the Third Estate?" to no avail.

The kind man almost always answered his own question, a fact which everyone knew but that didn't
stop us from squirming uncomfortably while he might possibly call on someone to answer. He never
did. At the time, I was grateful. Afterward I wonder whether the man did us a disservice. His
teaching was unobtrusive -- on our minds as well as our priorities -- and so we learned
comparatively little. Even now, I refer to him as "the kind man" because his name escapes
my recollection.

I remember the name of David P. Lyons.

On the first day of class, Prof. Lyons informed us that he believed in fairness, and since
propriety dictated that he go by his title, we should go by ours. Thus, for three hours a week, I
would be "Mr. Killeen," not merely "Benjamin." Likewise, I would come to know my classmates almost
exclusively as "Mr. Tyler" or "Ms. Bell," et cetera, requiring the slightly awkward
exchange of given names on the instances we met each other outside class.

Prof. Lyons' syllabus let us know what kind of class he intended to teach. Unlike his predecessor,
he intended to cold call, if he felt that someone was not contributing. He might ask about the
importance of associations in Tocqueville or what Nietzsche meant by master versus slave
morality. If the answer failed to impress, he reserved the right to ask us to leave. He never
exercised this right to its fullest extent -- actually tossing someone out -- but the fear of such
humiliation motivated us to prioritize his assigned readings over the Wednesday Bar Night, for
example.

I do remember one occasion, however, where he came very close. "Mr. Daniels," he said, at the
beginning of class. "What does Marx mean by relative surplus value?"

The poor student grasped at straws while Lyons prompted his slipshod memory, all the while claiming
that he couldn't keep his thoughts straight because he had read the passage so late at night. Maybe
he was telling the truth, or maybe he never touched the reading. Either way, no one could help
him. As he failed, more than once, to identify the author's definition of relative surplus value, a
deep sense of dread settled over his empathetic comrades, some of them too well aware that on
another morning they might have been just as unlucky. We waited for the moment when David Lyons
would exercise his right.

I remember the last question as if he burned it into my brain. "Mr. Daniels," Prof. Lyons
said. "I'm going to ask you this, and I trust you'll answer honestly." He paused.

Mr. Daniels nodded for him to continue.

"Did you do the reading?"

"Yes," said Mr. Daniels, but his tone of voice sounded unsure, as if he asked "Yes?" rather than
asserted it.

The professor took no notice. "All right then," he said, and he opened the question to the room.

In this way, the syllabus that Prof. Lyons put forth was not so much a guide for students to do
well in his class but rather a social contract, which all of us agreed to by staying in the
course. It should be noted that not everyone did stay, who was present on day one. The girl in
Model UN dropped next morning.

Later in the quarter, I happened to run into her. "I wasn't down for that," she told me, when I
asked about the class. "Just, no."

On its own, a harsh syllabus perhaps means very little, since so many professors treat the document
as more aspirational than actual. More declaration of independence, as it were, than constitutional
amendment 27. The difference was that Prof. Lyons enforced his syllabus. Or rather, he readily
reminded us of the particulars on the occasion we might forget. 

I remember one instance in particular. Ms. Bell began class by disagreeing strongly with Marx's
definition of value, namely that an object's value depends solely on the labor that goes into its
production, and wished to discuss it. Prof. Lyons didn't. After several attempts to redirect the
conversation, Prof.~Lyons reached into his messenger bag, withdrew a copy of the syllabus, and got
up from his chair. Ms. Bell kept speaking. Lyons marched around the table to her seat, which was
just next to mine, and laid the syllabus in front of her.

He pointed to a specific paragraph. "Read that," he said, interrupting her in mid-sentence, "and
if, after reading it, you still feel that your question merits a discussion in my class, I will be
happy to address it."

I could see the paragraph he pointed to. I couldn't help but read it alongside Ms. Bell, while
Prof. Lyons returned to his seat. It read:

> All of the texts we will read this quarter come from times very different from the present. As a
> result, the authors of these texts will make at least some claims with which you will no doubt
> disagree. When that happens, keep in mind that all the texts we will read this quarter contain
> some of the most important thoughts the human race has ever produced. Consequently, when
> disagreements between an author and you arise, try to understand (1) why an author has made the
> claim with which you disagree, (2) the broader purpose or purposes the author might be seeking to
> accomplish by making that claim, (3) what is at stake in both that claim and your disagreement
> with it, and (4) the weaknesses and limits of your own position. The more honest you are with
> yourself on this last point, the greater the benefit you will derive from our readings.

After reading this paragraph, Ms. Bell fell silent. At length, the conversation moved on, and when she
spoke again, after some time, she did not raise the same complaint.

Over the quarter, I got the sense that Prof. Lyons cared more deeply about imparting some sense of
truth on his students than about the particular content he was teaching. I do not mean "truths,"
such as those particular truths that Marx or Tocqueville put forth, but "truth" as a concept in of
itself: the idea that some positions are inherently correct, others are wrong, and still others can
be argued. Recognizing these categories is difficult. Yet Lyons clearly considered it a much more
crucial skill than the crucial skill than explaining anything John Stuart Mill had to say in *On
Liberty*. Often, he quoted the line from his favorite movie, "That's just your opinion, man,"
sometimes ironically, sometimes directed toward himself, and sometimes as a gentle reminder that
one or all of us might simply be wrong.

Of course, David Lyons himself had some very strong opinions. In "Guidelines for Written Work," a
separate document which he distributed alongside the syllabus, Prof. Lyons listed several
"contemporary barbarisms" of modern writing, which we should avoid in our essays unless we wished
for a one third lower letter grade. These included the word "impact" used for anything other than
physical objects literally striking one another, and "proactive", which made one sound like a
management consultant trying to fit more syllables into every word. Plain, honest "active" worked
just as well. Lyons also disliked words like "incentivize" and "problematize," which, according to
him, "add nothing to the English language" and "instead tend to rob the language of other useful
words and reduce the tools we have available for thinking about the world."

I imagine Prof. Lyons would object to my characterizing these positions on writing as mere
opinions. Indeed, I believe that following them made me a better writer. Yet the distinction
between fact and "just your opinion, man" illustrates the kind of truth that Prof. Lyons cared so
deeply about. Over the objections of his students, many of whom felt that "impact" worked just fine
as a synonym for "effect," he imposed his own opinion because he could support it. He pointed to
the appendix of George Orwell's essay, "[The Principles of
Newspeak](https://orwell.ru/library/novels/1984/english/en_app)" as the basis for his "Guidelines,"
an elegant and enjoyable piece of persuasive writing which Orwell included in the appendix to
*1984*. Along with Prof. Lyons, I highly recommend giving it a read.

A different section of the Guidelines perhaps servers as a summary of David Lyons's philosophy on
truth. At least, it speaks of the truth insofar as it can be argued. He advises any would-be writer:

> Avoid unfounded assertions. Occasionally students will simply claim that the world in which we
> live, especially human life, is a certain way and then proceed to write a paper as though that
> assumption were true.  One problem with this approach is that most really interesting claims
> about human life can be contested.  Accordingly, when you feel tempted to write a statement like
> “all human beings yearn for [insert nebulous value here],” ask yourself at least three
> questions. First, how do I know such a claim is true? Second, might there be evidence that runs
> counter to my claim?  Third ... what do I mean by [nebulous value]? You might then find yourself
> highlighting the text in question and hitting “delete.” There is no shame in that.

Prof. Lyons reviled weak opinions. This is not to say he never had any, I should think, but rather
that he worked hard to strengthen or remove them. He constructed his positions out of more atomic
truths, such as what Hume actually wrote, and sought out others' arguments to test against his
own. Thus, one could hardly say to David Lyons, "Yeah, well, that's just your opinion, man,"
because it was seldom just *his* and never *just* an opinion.

On the other hand, David Lyons readily admitted when multiple arguments made sense, even if he
preferred one above the rest. On the last day of class, the assigned reading consisted of neither
Marx nor Nietszhe, nor even Hannah Arendt. Instead, we discussed the graphic novel *Watchmen*, by
Alan Moore.

"So," Prof. Lyons began. "Who is the hero of *Watchmen*?"

This was the essay prompton *Watchmen*. It was deceptively open-ended, with any number of possible
answers. Should one choose Dr. Manhattan, the blue man with god-like power to manipulate matter?
What about Ozymandius, who undoubtedly saved the most lives but sacrificed millions in the process?
Should a hero believe in right and wrong? If so, then the black-and-white Rorshach stands alone by
sticking to his principles.

Ultimately, the choice depended on one's definition of "hero," but that didn't mean that every
choice was reasonable. We would be graded on the soundness of our argument. Thus, Prof. Lyons urged
us not to argue on behalf of Edward Blake, the amoral vigilante with little regard for human life,
whose grisly murder paints the opening pages of *Watchmen* red. Edward Blake was not the hero,
plain and simple. Any opinion that argued as much would likely fall short of the high standard by
which David Lyons estimated truth. That is to say: reasoning.

Opinions based on such a firm foundation are not so easily dismissed as *the dude*'s oft-repeated
abnegation would like to assert. The choice of *Watchmen*'s hero was definitely up for debate, as
most matters opinion are, but that didn't make every position debatable. No one claimed the
comedian as their hero. Moreover, no one felt so strongly about their own position that they were
unwilling to adopt someone else's definition of "hero," in order to understand their
argument. Thus, we reached a closer approximation of truth, on that hot Tuesday morning on May,
while David Lyons listened thoughtfully, all the while drinking his La Croix.

David Lyons, for his part, thought the hero of *Watchmen* was Bernard, the ordinary man who sold
newspapers on a street corner in New York. He told us at the end of class, not particularly
bothered that no one shared his opinion.

"Have a good summer," he added. "Keep in touch."
