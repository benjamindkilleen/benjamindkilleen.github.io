I can be reached via email at killeen [at] jhu.edu. I am happy to hear from you!

### Students:

I strongly believe in the value of mentorship for research. My typical student has a strong
background in programming and some exposure to deep learning. If you are interested in working with
me, please reach out via email with the following:
- Your CV/resume,
- A recent (unofficial) transcript,
- The intended period of study and level of commitment (casual or independent study),
- Your main area of interest, which should be aligned with my [recent
publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QX7AvxUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and
- A brief description of how working with me aligns with your long term professional goals.

Please also CC my advisor, Mathias Unberat (unberath [at] jhu.edu).
