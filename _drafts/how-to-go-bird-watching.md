# Part II: How to Go Bird Watching

It was my fourth-year Spring quarter. I asked Peter O'Leary for coffee, and instead he took me bird
watching.

The invitation surprised me. I had expected perhaps a twenty-minute conversation between classes,
which most professors will accommodate, or . Do people actually go
bird watching? For fun?

Upon reflection, however, it proved to be in
keeping with his usual mode of office hours. The archetypal wizard holds secret knowledge, the kind
of knowledge that only passes through personal apprenticeship. Although I could have memorized the
colorings in a guide book or listened to birdsongs online, I would still lack the experiental
know-how of spotting them. It takes a master of the craft to induct an initiate bird watcher.

I didn't know what to expect. Peter O'Leary invited me along because he had a routine on those
Springtime Tuesdays he spent on the South Side, and he saw no reason to deviate from it. Bird
watching goes just as well with heavy conversation as a cappuccino, after all.

We met at 4 PM. After a short walk to the park, we slowed our pace and meandered between an asphalt
path and the muddy shoreline. In place of a wizard's staff, Peter wielded pair of binoculars which
settled almost over his glasses. Translucent green leaves poked tentatively out from mostly-naked
branches. Rib-thin squirrels rushed from trunk to trunk about some official business far too urgent
for explanation. Playing orchestra for this theater, a flock of swallows settled in the treetops,
replenishing their strength for a week or two as they made their annual pilgrimage to Canada. Peter
pointed out how to rocognize their distinctive wingtips, in between my questions about taking a year
off to study writing.
